[[Richard]] [[The Secret History]] 
He was dating with Kitty, the thing, that was annoying him the most, was how common and usual their fighting was.

One girl from a party told him that he needed to loosen up, because he was too stressed. Richard answered that he was as loose as it was possible for him. Simply put, Richard also needed to loose himself, he drunk 6 cups of vodka for a reason, he was not an ordinary teenager, he was not that special from the rest of the Greek club.
