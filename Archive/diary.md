We could see the Pharaoh Tomb, a suspicious little statue, numbered hidden symbols, several names on the walls, cipher looking like a wheel (2) and cipher looking like a keyboard (1). From audio recordings, we realized that we should write the name of Pharaoh in cipher (1). We used the alphabet (he lay on the table) to find compliance between Russian names and symbols on the keyboard. We took the first letter from each name to get the name of Pharaoh. It took a lot of time because the alphabet had a cipher too. Pharaoh's tomb opened. There were tips for cipher (2). The cipher had several wheels. We had to put the right symbols in a row. However, for this we had to solve something like a puzzle from the tomb. We did all this and the door opened.

I got some information about the English Olympiad. The maximum score is 84. The first place earned 71 points. I have earned 60 points. I don't know what place I have taken.
==February 18th, 2021==
I earned 63/100 points in Russian. The best result was 79/100 points. I was also invited to the English Olympics. The Olympiad is organized by the Institute of Foreign Languages in Gorlovka. It will be on the Internet.
==February 19th, 2021==
Today I wrote a laboratory work on 5. Also, I was the only one in time passed 4 lectures on astronomy. I think we can try to participate in the Olympics. However, I think we can only use the old schedule(расписание).
==February 20th, 2021==
Today I had physics and mathematics. We had a physics test. In the third double lesson, there was a fire alarm.
==February 24th, 2021==
Today was a frosty day. Also today my grandmother came to us. I am not at home and did not see her.
==February 25th, 2021==
Today I got a 4 for my independent work in physics. Also yesterday I got 4 for words and 5 for work in an English lesson
==February 26th, 2021==
I have a homework in English. I have to retell the text "Meals". Today there was a very strange situation. Teacher in physics decided to make a couple to return debts(долги) (laboratory work, abstracts(конспекты), homework). I did not have debts and was released 30 minutes before the end of the lesson. I took your medicine.
### March
==March 1st, 2021==
Tomorrow we will have physics consultation. Tomorrow we can do a lesson at 19:00
==March 3rd, 2021==
today we can do a lesson. The students really had to make the menu. However, only I did it. I got 5 for the text and for the menu. Also I have to finish the work I started in the class.
==March 4th, 2021==
I got marks for my homework and class work. It is also possible that there will be no physics tomorrow.
==March 5th, 2021==
There was no physics today. In the fourth lesson, we were sent to watch the performance. There were several singers, several rock groups and one scene(сценка). The scene was funny.
==March 9th, 2021==
today the whole group had a medical examination. I got my freedom only at 1:30 pm. As a result, I will have to treat my teeth in Donetsk on Saturday at 8 am.
==March 10th, 2021==
Today I read the entire introductory piece. We can do a lesson today
==March 11th, 2021==
Today I received 4 in physics. Also today I read to part with an accide nt story
==March 12th, 2021==
Today the physics teacher was in good shape(в ударе). She managed to ask everyone and open a new topic. I almost finished reading the book. 
==March 15th, 2021==
Physics teacher was in a good spirit again. I still have not received information about the Olympics.
==March 16th, 2021==
I met the teacher. She told me to perform a test today at home. I also have a very funny story about "crime and punishment." However, I can tell it only tomorrow when I see the final.
==March 17th, 2021==
I'll start from the beginning. We had independent work in computer science.
I solved all 3 tasks. However, almost the rest of the class completed 0 or 1.5 assignments. After that, the teacher left our work on the desk and left class. We were left alone in the class. At this point, one student suggested correcting the work. After that, I decided to use a joke to make them think about the situation.
"Let me see. On the one hand, you can change the results of minor independent work. On the other hand, you can get a reprimand from the head of the department (our computer science teacher). You can lose his trust, the trust of the class teacher, and make the grades in this subject much worse. Hmmmmm ... Yes. I think this is an equivalent exchange."
Most of the class laughed and dropped the idea. However, time passed and the teacher was not returning. The students started their business. I did not stop them (Firstly, I could not convince everyone. Secondly, sometimes it is useful to allow a person to make a mistake. In this case, he will draw his conclusions).
Everyone rewrote their work and was already enjoying their rest.
Suddenly, one detail surfaced. There was one job on a large piece of paper. The teacher wrote something on it and wrapped all the other works in it. The owner of this work remade it on a regular sheet from a notebook, and the old one was destroyed. Everyone who rewrote their work was in a panic. It was a funny show. The teacher came at the end of the lesson. He let us go and did not look at the work.
Next lesson The teacher took our work into his own hands ... and ...
==March 18th, 2021==
I got 5 for words and 5 for class work. I also got an assignment. I have to write 5 sentence about the British Museum.
==March 18th, 2021==
The teacher took our work into his own hands ... and ... After t hat he asked the topic we were learning, made notes on the piece of paper and put the work on the shelf (in my opinion, due to the larger volume of his own work, he forgot that already made notes on the first sheet). We all breathed a sigh of relief.
We repeated the old topic and he decided to do another test (he warned that there will be many tests this week). We wrote this test.
After that, he gave us an assignment and left. His assistant remained in the class.
He worked with a computer. Then we worked with the assignment until the end of the lesson. Everything went well.
However, after the lesson, one student said that it was a pity that they were not alone in the class. He wanted to fix his work while the teacher was away.....
==March 19th, 2021==
Today we wrote a survey on theory in physics. I think I'll get 4 or 5. We can take a lesson today at 19:00-20:30
==March 22nd, 2021==
Today I had a physics test. I also had 5 double lessons. There was informatics in the fourth and fifth lessons. The teacher took lesson 5 because many of the students in the class did not know his subject. However, he was busy that day. Therefore, for almost all 2 lessons, we were sitting without work. We only had a test at the end of lesson 2. It was a terrible waste of time.
==March 23rd, 2021==
Today I received 5 for a good reading of the lecture on ecology. I also received 5 for the Russian test. I also decided what themes I will use for Harry Potter's analysis.
1)Analysis of antagonists in the book (I will take several antagonists from the book. I will make an analysis of how the author represents antagonists. What uses the author to manage the reader's opinion. I believe that it will be a good way to explore the author's tools).
2)Harry Potter Universe (I will try to think about the features of such stories. Perhaps I will be able to explain for myself the causes of Harry's behavior and a weak universe).
3)Perhaps I will try to compare the book and the film of Harry Potter.
==March 24th, 2021==
Today I got a 5 for my work in an English lesson. I have no homework.
==March 25th, 2021==
I I had physics. I got 4 for the test and 4 for the work in the lesson.
We also had a funny case in mathema tics.
The teacher called the student to complete the assignment. The teacher left the class. The task was easy, but there were several opinions about the correct answer.
There were 4 groups:
1)5cos(1/5);
2)1/5cos(1/5)(my group);
3)Of course a student who was standing near the blackboard and was weak in mathematics.
4)And of course those who were weak in mathematics but did not stand at the blackboard. 
In the end, my team was right. One of my friend even won a RUBLE (he bet for money).
### April 
==April 1st, 2021==
I showed my essay to the teacher.She liked it.I got 5 for it.In addition, the teacher said that she would watch Death Note. 
==April 2nd, 2021==
At this point, I have better grades than I expected.I have a chance of a higher grand.Also today we had a strange physics lesson.The teacher opened a new topic, showed experiments and even answered our questions.Moreover, on Monday we will not have physics.
==April 6th, 2021==
Today I had math in t he third and fourth double lesson. However, the teacher let us go from the 4th lesson. We can take a lesson today.
==April 7th, 2021==
I got my English homework. I have to learn the words(for Wednesday) and retell the text(for Thursday). I also got a 5 for the dialogue I made up in class:
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Sir.
-I want to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
-Is the plane on April 9 at 12 am good for you?
-Yes. However, I have a question. Can I use a laptop with a battery of 8 amps/hour on board?
-No, you can only put it into baggage.
-Thank you. Give me one ticket.
-Here you are. It's 250 bucks
-Thank you. Goodbye..
==April 8th, 2021==
I am still writing an essay on Harry Potter.At this point, I like the result.However, the process is slow because I try not to lose anything.Plus I find interesting new details.I think I should talk about it even if it takes more time. 
The final chapter of the manga in English translation has appeared today.There were 45 pages with a lot of text.I'm still digesting(перевариваю) the ending.Also, our group is forced to perform on stage on April 26th.We have to rehearse after school.I don't think I can finish my essay before Saturday.
==April 9th, 2021==
Today we wrote an independent work in physics.I wrote 8/11 assignments.We were also preparing for another independent work, which will be on Monday.
==April 13th, 2021==
Today I could not work with an essay again because of the script for the performance. I also work with the ecology project. We can do a lesson today at 20:00 (30 minutes), tomorrow (45 minutes) and on Friday (90 minutes).
==April 14th, 2021==
Today I got 5 for words.I also decidedto retell the text.I got 5 for this. Teacher said that we will do the assignments until 12 in the next lesson. I have already completed 7.
==April 16th, 2021==
I didn't get my homework yesterday.I lost my thermos today.I put it on the window.The bell rang and I went to class, forgetting about the thermos.When I remembered this, the thermos was gone.I didn't find my thermos among the lost items either.
==April 19th, 2021==
Today I solved test on the physics board.I don't know what marks I got.We won't be able to do a lesson today.
==April 20th, 2021==
I took your medicines.We can meet at the bus stop.I'll call you after repetition.We can do a lesson today at 19:30
==April 21st, 2021==
Today we rehearsed for 3 pairs.I still don't have a role.I only take part in the general song.Honestly, I think we are going to have a terrible performance.There are few(мало) people who give their efforts to their role.
I got 5 for my work in English. I also showed my essay on Harry Potter.She liked it, but found problems with text construction. I will send you an essay when everything will be fixed.
==April 22nd, 2021==
I am in a good mood.Today we did almost nothing in physics (we onlywrote 1 independent work).Moreover, tomorrow we will have mathematics instead of physics.Also, all people without a role were given freedom.
==April 23rd, 2021==
I did my math homework at the rehearsal today. The teacher also chose 4 people with a microphone. I'm one of them. Can you imagine how badly the other students sing?
==April 26th, 2021==
Today in physics we just wrote notes(конспекты).We also checked the test results.I think I found a time error that Natalia Alexandrovna (the name of the English teacher) spoke about.I also did some other minor corrections.
==April 27th, 2021==
In Russian lessons we have 2 groups with different teachers.There is a much stricter teacher in my groups.Today all 2 groups studied with Urubkova (this is the surname of my teacher).The teacher reminded several times that she was stricter.She was proud of it.It was funny.
==April 28th, 2021==
I had a special English lesson today.Teacher offered tea for us.We also bought sweets for tea.The tea was delicious.By the way, I got 5 for my work in the lesson.Homework is not available. Long.A very long time...
The concert began at 1 pm and ended at 5:15 pm.After that, we spent time in the classroom for discussion and other things.The result was better than I expected.There is a lot to discuss.However, there were many on duty to keep the phones banned. Therefore, I did not have time to write about the concert.I'll do it later.
==April 28th, 2021==
We had the third number of the performance.I watched the first two shows and realized that we are not such bad singers and dancers.
We went on stage.And the unexpected happened.We failed faster than I thought.The presenter(ведущий) went on stage and ... the music didn't work.There is some problem with the laptop.The presenter stood for two minutes and tried to entertain the crowd until the music started. After that, everything went smoothly.We performed better than at the rehearsal.
^^//A selection of interesting moments^^ 
my favorite quote: "Spring is a great time of the year. Many people enjoy it already, but not all. Because DTPA students are preparing for their debut".
There was one scene with the charismatic voice of the lead. Someday I can try to make a dubbing of this scene in English.
Scene about benefits of duty(дежурства). In this scene, the duty(дежурный) banish(изгоняет) a armed robbers using a broom.
There was a group that created a video and showed it as a performance. There was a funny moment. They took a picture with a beetle and a recorded voice of a angry teacher. I think they will get problems because of this.
A scene where two students with poor grades were discussing the math teacher.Interestingly, they mentioned the name of the teacher.(I am very sorry that I could not see the teacher's face at this moment).
There was a rock concert where the vakalist sang one song in English//After the concert
After the speech of the groups, the referee needed time. Therefore, they invited rock band. Rock concert lasted an hour. It was too loud and long. We got cake and candy for our performance.We came to the classroom.
The teacher decided to bring a knife.However, while the teacher was away, the students found a fork, cut the cake and ate everything instantly.Some even pulled pieces out of the cake with their hands.It was a funny sight.
//results
There were 14 groups in total.The results were incredible.We got 3rd place in the "chromoscopy" category, 1st place in the "closest group" category and 2nd place in the main category.Even though our performance was bad, others were even worse. Our teacher was very pleased.Because her class group took 2nd place, and her department took 1st place.
==April 30th, 2021==
Today I went to the bank and paid the bill for my mother. Today we can make an unusual retelling. For example, retell all that we know about Lule Lendry. We can also listen to the excerpt from the CC, which we have not read. After that we will try to retell that we understood 
### May
==May 2nd, 2021==
Today I have already fulfilled all written homework. Therefore, then I will try to read the "Master and Margarita" and do other things.
==May 3rd, 2021==
I read "reading like work and creativity."
In my opinion, this analysis has a topic that does not need proof. Moreover, all the ideas and theses (тезисы) were not new to me.
The main problem of this analysis is too much water. At first the author says some idea / rule. After that, he explains in detail how we had to understand his words, brings examples, and then, after several pages, reminds of this idea. When I read this article, I did not feel any freedom for reflection.In any case, I do not regret about reading this article, because it helped to clearly formulate thoughts on this topic.
==May 4th, 2021==
I read 1 chapter of the book and noticed two interesting features:
The book is not trying to explain the reader what is happening. The book immediately shows the action without the introduction. Other books and films are trying to enjoy the consumer. However, this cannot be said about this book.
In the first chapter, the heroes discussed the topic of religion. However, I think that the topic of religion was just a tool to show the society of that time. Maybe I will read the work in full, if the teacher does not hurry.
==May 5th, 2021==
Today I read 2 and 3 chapters. However, the teacher said that we should read this book in reducing until the next Wednesday. We will also have to fulfill a large project. I think the recovery of the diary will go slowly because of reading the book.
==May 6th, 2021==
Today was a strange day. We had to watch a movie about astronomy. However, the hall was busy. Therefore, we just wrote notes(конспекты).
There is a lot of homework for tomorrow. In addition, the teacher in physics wanted me checking other people's work.
I will tell another strange detail in the form of a joke:
-English teacher: we overtake the program, you are the fastest group!
-History teacher: I was sick for a long time and was on courses. We missed more than a month of the program.
-Literature teacher: I was also on courses.
-Computer science teacher: Soon we will have an exam.
-A man who chooses a subject for consultation: Of course we choose English! P.S: Today we should not have consultation.
==May 7th, 2021==
I have to learn the words on the first page. We did not perform any other exercises. About MM, I haven't read much because of other cases. I'll write about it later. I also received 5 in history and mathematics.
==May 9th, 2021==
Today I was the presenter at the holiday in Yasinovka.Everything went smoothly.It was the most common holiday.The only funny thing was a children's song in Russian with some English words (People со всего мира. Let's будем дружными, etc.)
==May 10th, 2021==
This afternoon I went to football.We had a good game.I scored 2 goals.Our team lost, but that doesn't make me sad.
==May 11th, 2021==
Today I was in Yasinovka.I was the presenter.I performed better today than on May 9th.
==May 12th, 2021==
I have already read "The Master and Margarita" in abbreviated form.I have homework.I have to do the exercises on page 3 (I did the part, but they will need to be tested).
==May 13th, 2021==
Today I got a 5 for my work in an English lesson.We have completed page 3. I have not received my homework. 
There was also a funny situation in the lesson.
Another English teacher came in.Both teachers decided to eat something.The students offered to go to the store for them.The teachers wanted shawerma. They asked many questions: who knows where there is delicious shawerma, what kind of filling, asked not to add pickles. There was no written test on literature today.We'll read another big book soon.
==May 14th, 2021==
Today I got 5 in physics for laboratory work and 5 more for independent work.We threw grenades during the initial military training. 
==May 18th, 2021==
Today we wrote a control dictation in Russian (we were not warned).
I think we should alreadygive 1 lesson a week for Russian.I also recognised that this week we will study on Saturday. One more thing.Today we had physics.
It was weird.Because we didn't get physics on the consult or replacement list (I'll share my guesses later).
And on Saturday, we will have another physics as a replacement.It's going to be a very difficult week ... Five physics in a week (all days except Wednesday). 
And one more thing.After a couple, I went up to the teacher to ask a question.It turns out that the teacher has a very high opinion of me. 
She asked about my studies.She said that she would give me a 5, unless, of course, I became lazy.However, all this is not so good.I already know this teacher well enough.There isn't nothing easier than losing her trust.
==May 19th, 2021==
Today we completed pages 7 and 8 in the English lesson.I will send you the correct version of that exercise. 
Another story about an English lesson.As you know, we had English in the fifth double lesson on Monday.We were told that there will be no first lesson on Wednesday 26th. 
However, some students decided that it was about this Wednesday.They started to argue about it in conversation(беседа в соц.сети)".Many students believed it (of course, because they wanted it to be true), and as a result, the first lesson was less than half of the class.Interestingly, we had a class hour that day.I was expecting a show. 
However, this did not happen (perhaps she did not look at the absent list(список отсутствующих)).
==May 20th, 2021==
Today we were protecting laboratory work in physics. In most cases, it is very difficult . However, today it was ... It was... something more. She asked about the theory, about the theory for the previous topics, asked to solve exercises(задачи) and draw diagrams. There were not many people who received 4. Even some students who were respected by the teacher also received 2 or 3 points. However, I was prepared and somehow received 5.Also during protection, the teacher gave a task for us. These were tests. However, I decided, just in case(на всякий случай), write my way of solving tests. Not everyone managed to perform this task. However, to my surprise, I received 12 correct answers from 12. The teacher was very pleased and I received another 5.
==May 22nd, 2021==
Today was a full-time working day. The teacher has already checked the dictations. I made 2 gramothic mistakes, and punctuation one. I got 4 points. I learned the criteria for her assessment(оценивания) and will tell you later. She took the dictation sheet and forbade me to take a photo. However, we wrote out errors.
==May 24th, 2021==
On Saturday we were asked to come today in nice clothes.Russian language teachers had to choose one group from the first year.We have become this group.They did not know exactly what order would come.According to the first version, it was supposed to be just a photosession.However, it was a dictation with photo session.We wrote a dictation.The teachers do not yet know if these works will be sent to the city.
We also have to go do the online test on the Russian language and literature.Should I do it alone or will we do it together?
==May 26th, 2021==
I had a productive day yesterday. I finally had movement in my personal plans. Today I got a 5 in basic military training. Today we can do the lesson at 19:30.
==May 28th, 2021==
I read chapters 22 and 23.
Today we had a standard(норматив) for basic military training.It was a press of a 16 kg kettlebell(гиря).The standard was 20 times for an excellent mark.I did 57 times and got 4th place in the group.
Also today I got a 5 for my physics lab.There were many questions in this lab.Moreover, we did not have these answers in the notebook(she usually dictates all the necessary theory).To get the job done, I had to look for the necessary formulas and another theory on the Internet and even in a book (to my shock, we have it). By the way, there was not all the necessary information.I have to visit her additionally with several questions. The rest of the students were less stupid than I and did nothing.The teacher was angry, but she had to explain everything.I was released because I already had a job done and was able to protect it.
I will send my impressions of the chapters, perhaps, later.With each chapter, it becomes more and more difficult to write new impressions.I don't want to go down to retellings.
==May 31st, 2021==
It turns out that only I was able to pass the laboratory workon Friday. Therefore, the teacher interviewed other students for most of this lesson. However, tomorrow we will have physics again (I cannot understand how she gets replacements).
### June
==June 1st, 2021==
Today, the Russian teacher could not give a lesson. She was busy (was on the exam). We can take a lesson tomorrow.
==June 2nd, 2021==
We received new sheets with the tasks in English. We did not receive homework.After all lessons we were sent to the assembly hall. 
We were showed a film about the dangers of smoking. For my surprise, the film was high-quality.
It is very sad that the film in any case will bring little benefit. I saw how students during the shower (ливня)go outside to smoke.
I am very surprised by their persistence. I do not think that this film will affect them.
==June 3rd, 2021==
Today in physics class, a third of the class were sent to the hospital (the hospital is in 15 minutes away).We have completed everything necessary.However, it took the whole lesson. I read your note. 
==June 4th, 2021==
I read your note.It was pretty interesting.Today we finally received assignments to prepare for the math exam.
Fun dialogue in physics: 
-Teacher: What a terrible handwriting!Did you want to study as a doctor? 
-Student: Yes, but changed my mind at the last moment. 
-Teacher: ... Well, quite a sudden change of profession.
==June 7th, 2021==
Today we had a standard with a gas mask.I got 4. Life with hair is difficult at times like this.Today we must prepare for tomorrow's Russian lesson.We can also work with an English manual.
==June 8th, 2021==
Today we had a Russian lesson.We wrote an independent work and a test(контрольную работу).Independent work had the topic "syntactic norms".I got 5 for this.There were different topics on the test.I don't know what grade I got.
==June 9th, 2021==
Today I got a 5 for my work in an English lesson.In the next lesson, we will be working with pages 3.5, 4.I think I can handle it myself.Also today we had the final test for the novel "Quiet Don".I think I will have a normal result.
==June 10th, 2021==
Today I received the last grade(зачёт).I got 5 in all subjects.However, there are still exams ahead. Next week, I may not go to subjects for which I already have a grade.However, I still have to go to the exam subjects.
==June 15th, 2021==
Today, at a Russian lesson, the teacher decided to make a consultation.I will throw off the photo with the received information.
==June 17th, 2021==
Joke from the math teacher:
The student came to the exam in biology, but only learned the topic "fleas".
He pulled out a ticket with the theme "wolves", thought a little and went up to the teacher.
-Student: wolves are animals, they live in the forest and they have wool.And in the wool ... there are fleas.And fleas are ...(talks about fleas).
 __The teacher was surprised__
-Teacher: Okay, tell me about the birds.
-Student: Birds are animals, they fly and have feathers.Fleas live in their feathers.And fleas are ... -Teacher: Okay, tell me about the fish.
 __The student thought for a long time__
-Student: Okay ... Fish live in water.They have fins and scales.But ... If they had wool, they would definitely have fleas!And fleas are ...
The teacher could only give him a grade
==June 23rd, 2021==
Today I had the first exam. I was well prepared. However, I had a bad luck relative to my ticket. I got theoretical questions that I did not know well. Also, the task of Exile was more difficult than the tasks of my neighbors. I answered all questions, but I can not be sure that I did everything right. 
==June 26th, 2021==
Today was a disgusting day. We wrote an exam in mathematics. I do not know the results, but I have a lot of doubts. (сомнений) about my work.
I also found out about the computer science exam. I want 5 for all exams, so I have to come on Wednesday for retake (пересдачи) of computer science.
==June 28th, 2021==
Today was a hard day.I left Donetsk only at 2 pm.I tried to speak with a computer science teacher to resolve this issue ^^today.^^Because this exam forces us to postpone family plans.However, the teacher was too busy today. However, there was a lot of good news today too.I got 5 for the exam in Russian, and in mathematics.
==June 30th, 2021==
Today was a tough day, again.I'll be home after 4:30 pm.Teacher didn't want to put a 5 because it was my second try.It took too long to come to an agreement with him.I don't think we can do a lesson today.
### July
==July 1st, 2021==
Today I was playing football.However, we were unable to get other familiar players out of their homes.Everyone was busy.Therefore, at first, I and my friend, Maxim, played alone.
However, an hour later a group of fifth graders came to the field.We split into two teams (For simplicity, let's call them Maxim's team and my team).Also, a girl came with other children.She stated that she has knew football rules well and she would be a referee.
There were many interesting rules and situations on the field:
The goalkeeper cannot leave the goal (ворота).
The referee always brings balls from out (аут).
Players cannot go outside the field.
The referee throws outs herself. She throws the ball into the air (like in basketball).
The referee throws off outs always in one place (on our part of the field).
Sometimes you can touch the ball with your hands (sometimes you can't).
Once a player from Maxim's team touched the ball with his hand.The judge appointed a penalty kick to our goal (в наши ворота).
It was a funny game.
==July 3rd, 2021==
We started a trip after lunch. It was a regular journey. We spent 5 hours at the border. We took breaks several times to allow dad to sleep a bit(he was a driver). On the way, we drove into the "Park of miniatures". The trip took 25 hours.
Park of miniatures
The main exhibits of this park are small versions of the Crimean attractions (достопримечательности). They were very detailed and beautiful.
There were also many types of animals. There were: Tigers, zebras, bison, monkeys, raccoons, beavers, moose, deer, various birds, fish and other animals. I made a lot of photos. If you are interested, I can send them.
==July 9th, 2021==
There were many surprises today.This situation made me cancel my English lesson today.It's hard for me to make plans while I'm at my grandmother's house 
I found an interesting book on philosophy.My essay will have a big change, again.
==July 10th, 2021==
Today we had an active working day.In the morning we were raving cherries.After that, we prepared fuel for the fire (for barbecue).After lunch, I cleaned up in the background(задний план).In the evening I had a shower.
==July 12th, 2021==
We have lost another lesson today.After lunch, the light disappeared.The light has appeared only now.
I am very sorry that I could not warn you. 
However, today I still had a successful day from some point of view.In the morning we went to the city with my grandmother.Grandma went to get the documents.
We were waiting for her for several hours in a car under the sun. 
However, I had a downloaded book by E. Fromm.Therefore, I did not waste this time. 
After dinner we had no light.However, I had a book on programming downloaded.I also had a program for teaching fast typing.
==July 14th, 2021==
Today we washed my grandmother's dog.The breed of the dog is chao-chao (has a lot offur).The dog has not been washed for several months.We were unable to completely wash the dog.But now she looks better.
==July 15th, 2021==
Yesterday I was combing (вычесывал) Bagira's (dog's name) fur.I collected the excess wool into a bag.I wanted my mother to make some kind of gift for my grandmother from this wool.We paid a lot of attention to Bagira.She was happy.
Bagira started screaming tonight.We didn't know what happened.
Over time, the dog's belly pouted. The dog made terrifying screams.Grandma was crying.We didn't have enough time to take the dog to the hospital.Bagira died.My brother and I buried the dog in the forest. 
The dog was 8 years old. This is a big age for this breed (порода). We believe that she ate some kind of bones or too much fat food.
We definitely won't make a gift from Bagira's wool...
Today I was in the Lion Park (it is the name). I will write about this later.
==July 16th, 2021==
Lion park
The park area is32 hectares. There were many animals, attractions, cafes, shops and other ways to dig in visitor pockets. However, there was only one elephant and there were no rhinos. Most of the animals were lions (who would think). Many animals were rare and beautiful. There were a lot of beautiful statues in the park. I made a lot of photos. I will send you this if you are i nterested.
Most of all I was surprised by feed stores for animals. We buy food from the zoo to feed their animals. Moreover, their prices are wild. For example, a kilogram of meat costs 1200 rubles.
In any case, I got bright emotions.
==July 26th, 2021==
Today was my dad's birthday.There were a lot of guests.We were grilling meat, playing games, training with a barbell.I still have things to do.Can we move the lesson in 20 minutes?
==July 27th, 2021==
Today I went to Yasinovataya by bicycle.I came to play football.I moved the lesson with LD because the start of the game was rather late.Many people had to come (должны были прийти).However, it started to rain.Most went home.The rain soon ended, but no one returned.There were only 3 players, including me.
However, it was still not bad.We went to practice on horizontal bars.
==July 29th, 2021==
Today I was visiting my friends.My brother andparents were with me.After barbecue we went to the lake.
We spent about an hour there and went back.There we ate a cake and then went to my house.At home we went to our gym.Today my friend and I were able to lift the barbell (штангу) with our weight for the first time(we did the bench press exercise (жим штанги лёжа))
### August 
==August 2nd, 2021==
Perhaps, you understood me wrong. I didn't tell that my problem ismy friend's opinion. Moreover, my friends understand that I really learn English and have results. Their requests for translations are motivated by interest. First of all, I worry about my own sense of the language.I cannot be sure of my skills.
==August 14th, 2021==
Funny dialogue with my grandmother:
-Are you still attending church?
-I don't go to church anymore.
-Oh, thank Godness!
==August 19th, 2021==
Planning the day.
Well ... it has always been a tough question for me.I had many options for planning the day.For example, for a long time my planned day sounded like this:
I have a big to-do list for the future.In the beginning, I decided how many hours of rest I have (the rest of the time I have to work). However, this scheme did not work.No matter how much time I gave myself to rest, I almost always broke my plans because of laziness.
For most of my life, I've considered to-do lists to be nonsense. But recently my opinion has changed (I will write the essay "why you should keep a to-do list" when I have a little more experience).Now I have my to-do list for only a few days.My productivity didn't increase too much (about 10 or 20 percent, I think).However, my attitude towards business has changed.Now, when I have a precise (точный) plan of action, I feel myself much better.
==August 19th, 2021==
I decided to study Photoshop more seriously.In the beginning, I decided to make a plan for learning Photoshop for several months in advance.
However, I could not find any good Photoshop tutorials in Russian.So I have good news and bad news.The bad news is that my only way is to use English lessons.However, it might be even better.
==August 24th, 2021==
Yesterday I found myself with lichen(лишай).Today I went to the hospital.The road turned out to be difficult because I was there for the first time (I am poorly оriented in space).Finding the hospital was difficult because none of the strangers knew where it was.When I got there, they started kicking me from office to office (with queues, of course).
So I'm in the final cabinet.The doctor gave me a list of medicines. He also said that one drug will be difficult to find, but they have it in their pharmacy. I leave the office and thanked for the work.After that, I started looking for a pharmacy.However, no one knew where it was.I went to the nurse and asked.And do you know what she said?She said that he sells the medicine personally in his office.Therefore, I had to stand in the queue for the office a second time.Why he said "in our pharmacy" and not "I can sell you" is not clear.Moreover, I have many other good questions.
==August 26th, 2021==
I've done a lot of things today. I finally paid off (отдал долги) to my to do list. Simply put, I had a productive day today, I am satisfied. Also today I finished preparing for the voice acting of Harry Potter (subtitles, sound). In the near future I will be trying to do voice acting for my characters.
==August 27th, 2021==
Today was also a productive day.I fulfilled all my plans for this day: sports (jump rope, pull-ups, abs (скакалка, подтягивания, пресс)), Japanese, Photoshop lessons in English, learning equalizer (voice processing (обработка голоса)), programming.
==August 28th, 2021==
Today I finished my part of the voice acting.I spent the whole day for this (I also helped my mom with the cleaning and also did a few minor things (мелких/не стоящих упоминания дел) ).It was very difficult but interesting.I wasted a lot of time, but I have no regrets.I got a lot of skills for video and sound editing.
==August 30th, 2021==
This time I had another doctor. She(doctor) considered, that skipping lessons is bad idea. Therefore she said to use the plaster and go to the classes. However, I have to be in the hospital in the Thursday.
==August 31st, 2021==
Today I was planing a day of rest.I woke up at 5:45, walked the dog and prepared an omelet for myself and my parents. They said that the omelet was tasty. After that I brewed tea and went to my room. However I can't name this day as "day of rest". I would name this day as "a day of shift activites (смены рода деятельности)".I decided to have a quite serious cleaning in the room. I will tell you about everything later. In any case, I got new forces and ready for the school year.
### September 
==September 2nd, 2021==
I have an English lesson on Thursdays. Today I got a home work. I have to learn words 1.1 and 2.1. Also I have to retell one of the texts (1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2).
Today we had a lesson with Чайка.I will try to write about her later when I will have enough information. However I could say that our lesson began with phrase: "Am I right that your class teacher is Natalia Vladimirovna? Okay, then let's not waste time, I think you are already in the know."
==September 3rd, 2021==
Today I had my first philosophy lesson.I expected it to be interesting.However, I was disappointed. This was not the teacher I was waiting for. It wasn't interesting at all. It seems more like a crocodile game(guess the words).
Teacher: Philosophy is a system of sciences that is relevant (актуальна) all over the world, so we can call it ... How do you think?
One of the students:
worldwide (всемирной)?
Teacher: wrong.
One of the students: general (общей)?
Teacher: no.
 __A few attempts later__ 
One of the students: universal?
Teacher: right! Чайка is a interestend person, she is a leagend in our college. Her reputation goes before her. You can easily hear about her far beyond her piece of building. She got her famous thanks for her cruelty and recklessness. And I finally met her.
==September 6th, 2021==
About the lessons of philosophy.I forgot to tell you that I already knew this teacher from last year. Also today we had this subject again. And my opinion became a little clearer.Much that the teacher says should be interesting (in theory). I've already read all this information in the book and it was very interesting. However when the teacher was telling this, it was boring. Why? I saw two reasons: 
1)I don't feel strengths in her voise and in the information she gives(it is hurd to explain on the paper). 
2)When you are reading the right/good book(and other ways of getting information), you feel the power in words. You can read the same text again and again, and every time you will find a new level of understanding. Why? Different books do it in different ways. For example, Psychological books give the reader the path of reflections. When you read these books you are trying to understand author'sreflection way. So what is the main problem of the teacher? She simply gives the facts. Students do not have space for reflection. And the only compensation is a crocodile game. What a pity. 
==September 7th, 2021==
Today we were at the performance in honor of the Day of the Liberation of Donbass. It took two double lessons.
In the third lesson, wewere just sitting, because the teacher was busy and left the office (this was a new lesson "people and society").Several people left the couple because they thought she would not return.However, she discovered their absence.The most interesting thing is that they left 10 minutes before the end of the lesson.
==September 9th, 2021==
I had homework for English. I have to learn words 3.1 and 4.1. By the way, I got 5 for words and retelling. 
Tomorrow will be a hard day. We will have a test on information technologies, philosophy, mathematics test for all the first course knowledge and, as a snack, lesson with Чайка. Wpe won't have a lesson today. 
Today I was in the hospital again. Every time I do the same things.A'm so used to it that it is hard to surprise me. However this time they maneged with it, because they almost lost my m card. Also I have to be in the hospital on Saturday.
==September 10th, 2021==
Today was a hard school day (учебный день). However I've managed with everything well. Today we can make a lesson at 19:00-20:30(if it is comfortable for you).
==September 13th, 2021==
Today I was in th e hospital. I spand a lot of time to get there, and you know what was waiting for me? A closed door! Honestly, I don't know what acast of mind a person should have to tell me to come on Saturday 11th, wrote it on my card, knowing that the hospital will be closed.
==September 11th, 2021==
Today we didn't have the 4th pair due to the teacher's illness. Also today I read 3 pages of the CC. However, I am not sure, is this a good idea to read CC in the buses.
==September 14th, 2021==
Today we had the subject "human and society". We were talking aboutindividual development, narrative indentifity and other things. It was realy interesting. To be honest, I will not say, that this teacher takes his subject seriously.She was completely absent in the last lesson and in the begging of this. However I can say for sure, that her lessons is more useful than our philosophy lessons. Why? Because shegives us a space for reflection. Of course, you can say that our philosophy teacher gives a base for us and it is important. Maybe, butat what a price? I'll give you an example. I have already heard such a phrases:
 __"I wantedto learn philosophy, I thought it would be interesting, but after our philosophy lessons, I've change my opinion.".__ 
==September 15th, 2021==
Today we finally started writing programs on the computer.Apart from this there were nothing interesting. We can made a lesson today at 19:15-20:45.
==September 16th, 2021==
Today we were just sitting on the second lesson. It've happened thanks to someone's mistake. Our teacher was ill, but nobody thought about this(usually, in such a cases, control room have to move our lessons). Anyway I have a business in this time. Also today I was going to gave an answer in the Чайка's lesson. Usually she uses a celling to find a victim. I prepared harder for this lesson than usual. However she said that she was not interesting in testing me at this moment.
==September 17th, 2021==
Teacher of history choose me to participate in the history competition (I have no choice).Today my opinion of a philosophy teacher has dropped even deeper. There was a lot of details, so I'll told you everything latter. Shorty, she made a mistake,accused us in this, and after this gave us4 album sheet of tight text (плотного текста) so that we rewrote them literally (дословно)(what we will not have time to do, we have to do at home), and left. Today I got 5 for Чайка' s lesson. By the way I have to learn words 5.1 for English lesson.
==September 21st, 2021==
Today I got 5 for the subject "Basics of the programming".Also we had a physical education. There was a few tests for the next two months. I pass it all on 5. Ispend a lot of time on buses. I've seen many types of strange people, but my favourite one is:
Driver: Will someone get off at the next stop?
 __A second of silence__ *
Our character: everyone are silent (все молчат).
==September 22nd, 2021==
What do I want? It'ssounds like a very simple questions. However, there are few (немного) people which seriously think about it. Why things are so (почему дела обстоят именно так)? Everybodybelieves that answer is obvious. Are they right? I can say for sure that this position is wrong. 
Each person sometimes has moments when doubts (сомнения) suddenly appears, when you realize that something is wrong in your doings. Usually people try to forget and not thing about such a doubts. However, it is not the way to solve the problem. In our time persontakes other people's desires (желания) as own too easily, oftenacts for the somebody's opinion (ради чужого мнения),allows somebody to decide what is important to him and what is not. The most worst thing here, that person, usually, can't separate his personal desires from external (внешних) ones. 
This is a ridiculous version of an essay that I will write later. I hadto write it to explain the origin (происхождение) of my decision. 
Yesterday I spend a lot of time, thinking about my own desires. I realized, thatI was not interesting in historian olyphiad at all, moreover I don't need such a knowledges (most of thetopics is names of peoples, weapons and other stuff). I felt a strong disgust about this situation and myself, so I decided to refuse this event. I did it. Teacher was upset, but wasn't angry.
==September 24th, 2021==
Today I got 5 for learnd english words. Also I got another 5 for work in class, however, the teacher said that I had more grades than can be written in the journal. Also today we had a test from Чайка. I think I did it well. In the second lesson teacher was busy, so she asked the fourth grader (четверокурсника) to taught us. And you know what? It was really interesting. He had the real experience as a programmer and shared it with us.
==September 23rd, 2021==
Today, as I expected, I got 5 for Чайка's test.Today I was in hospital.The doctor said that I was well, but I have to be in hospital in a month.
==September 27th, 2021==
Distance learning showed it's most interestingparties from the very beginning. One teacher desided that practical works shouldbe written on special forms, and the best time to say it would be after 4 pm(we have to made it until 3 pm tomorrow). Therefore, I had to go to the city today.
### October 
==October 10th, 2021==
I was offered to play football at 4pm today. However,my friend said it for me at 3pm. I already had plans for this day.I had to refuse (мне пришлосьотказаться).However, after a few minutes I changed my mind. 
There was a lot of people.We had a good game. However, I and my friend made a mistake.We missed the bus (опоздали на автобус).Therefore, we hadto walk (нам пришлось прогуляться). We played football near school 7.
==October 12th, 2021==
Today we received grades on the Чайка's subject. I rewrote that lecture word by word, in normal handwriting, and got a 4. No one got 5. It looks like she's not going to give us a good marks for distance work. 
==October 17th, 2021==
Today I had a pretty productive day.The only one mistake, that I made is oversleep. I wanted to woke up at 5:15 am, but did it at 6:15. Anyway it was a great day. All day long I wasimmersed (погружен) in programming and learning other useful things. Of coure, I had a breaks. However, it wasn't procrastination, I did it consciously. I hope that I will be able to keep thisdaily regime.
==October 21st, 2021==
I rarelywritenotes lately (в последнее время). And, to be honest, it is hard to find something, that would be interesting for you when I'm sitting at home. Moreover, you have heard nothingabout book "Excape from Freedom" from me in the last time. However, I still have plans for this. I didn't take a break. And about notes, I will try to come up with something about this. 
==October 22nd, 2021==
Today was a hard day.Practical work on the architecture of computer systems was very indistinct (невнятные). I still have a homework for tommorow. We can make a lesson tommorow at 14:30.
==October 25th, 2021==
Today I played football. I got unexpected invitation. Firstly, I wanted to refuse, but my friends were persistant. I agreed.
We came to the field, but part of it was underthe leaves. We askedfor tools at school. School workers were shocked, but gave it. We cleaned the field. However no one came, there were only 4 players in the field. 
We played in simple games for about 2 hours. After that we went home. 
==October 23rd, 2021==
Today I played football. It was a good game. Most of the game I was adefender or goalkeeper. This time we caught the bus. However, I haven't managed with my homework.
==October 26th, 2021==
I woke up with an interesting news.
Чайка found a mistake at the very beginning of my homework. Because of it I have to remake all my work. Also a teacher of math logicalsaid that we understood the task wrong and we have to remake it (perhaps, this is a talent, to be able to explain the task in such a way, that every single student understood it in the same way and this way was wrong). It took almost a whole day.
==October 30th, 2021==
Ihad a lesson with LD at 8 am today. After that I was invited to play football. We came to the field. However we found a game there. There were many players, toomany to add a few more players. We waited for ouropportunity, but after 40 minutes I decided to leave.
### November 
==November 4th, 2021==
I and mt mother was in my grandmother's house today (she lives in Yasinovataya).I helped her and my grandfather with computer staff. We had lunch and tea. After that we went home. We got home at 16:10.
==November 7th, 2021==
I had a productive day today. I have made a lot of things today. I made homework for subject "basicsof programming" for next week. I also made a good progress with my own programming course and did many other useful stuff. I think the rest is an important part of a productive day.I'll add more details on Tuesday. I will write two smallessays on Monday and Tuesday.
==November 14th, 2021==
One of our friends rents out apartments. One of the tenants (арендаторов) left the catwhen he moved. It was a purebred (породистая) cat. My mother desided to take this cat. The cat still doesn't trust us.At this point of time, she has been sitting behind my table for 2 hoursand growls (рычит). We left a food near the table.
==November 13th, 2021==
I was in the town today. I have been vaccinatedagainst the flue. Today I have a lesson with LD. Ibrought one vaccine for her friend. 
==November 18th, 2021==
There is news about distance learning.We will start attending classes from the 22th or 29thNovember. But it's not exactly.
==November 21st, 2021==
I'm going to class (занятия) tomorrow.I didn’t have time to complete all the plans.However, I will try to navigate in the conditions (условия) that I have.
==November 22nd, 2021==
Today was a simple day. I meneged with atest on mathematical logic. Teachers had a lot of good storyes about distance learning.For example, one of my classmates send only 5 letters to the math teacher. Two of them were congratulations about the recovery of the teacher. Other two were about his work she did not manage to check. 
There were students who did almost nothing in distance learning. One of my classmates did not do a single job (работы, домашнего задания). Our home teacher made a promise that he would be expelled.
==November 23rd, 2021==
Today was a simple day.We were allowed to leave after 3rd lesson. Tomorrow our group will have a class hour (I'm not sure how to translate it).
==November 24th, 2021==
Class hour (jokes)
Maxim student, orphan (сирота), lives in a hostel.
Nikita one of the students.
Natalie our class teacher.
Natalie: usually students are surprised how can know that they are smoking. No, seriously, what kind of mindset you need to have to smoke under class teacher's cabinet? Seriously, I am even able to spit (плюнуть) on their's heads.
Natalie: Be careful when you walk along the corridors. There are many low teachers in our building. You knock them down to often.
Nikita: so that's why I'm stumbling so often!?
Natalie: I know all your parents well, so you have to be careful!
Maxim: even my father?
==November 25th, 2021==
Tens of years ago we lost our math lesson due to the illness of the teachers. Someone have decided to move that lesson for today. So today we have to have a 5 double lessons. Situation:
All our group:__came to the 5th lesson__ .
Teacher: are you adequate?
We: yes, perhaps.
Teacher: then go home adequately!
==November 26th, 2021==
We didn't have the architecture test today. Чайка was just explaining the distance material today. And... she really knows how to explain when she wants to. 
==November 29th, 2021==
I will 5 double lessons tomorrow. Nothing special happened today. Ihad 3 double lessons today. 
### December

The open lesson was success. However no spectator came. Anyway, Seagull was pleased. Especially she liked my work.
==December 15th, 2021==
Today I got semester grades in math, programming and history. Everything is still going smoothly. However, exams are still ahead.
==December 16th, 2021==
The teacher of mathematical logic is considered the most strict teacher after Seagull (among our teachers). Today one student from our group (Nikita) failed to get semester grade. He swore at the teacher.
The teacher was furious. She made a complaint (paper) against the student and scolded the class teacher.
Natalie (our homeroom teacher) said that next time would be the last.If something like this happens again she will leave our group.
I would not like to be in the place of those who have not yet received the semester grade.
==December 17th, 2021==
I got 5 for all the semester's subject. Exams is still ahead. I received a letter from the recruitment office (военкомат). I have to go for a medical examination.
==December 20th, 2021==
Today on the third double lesson I was allowed to go home.
There was an unpleasant situation. The teacher left us (we were in the 116th Cabinet). Most students were noisy. Suddenly Seagull appeared in the class.
-“If I bother you, you should tell me. In this case I will stop my lesson and leave. Just give me a hint”. She said it and went back to her class.
==December 21st, 2021==
Tomorrow I have my first exam. It's theory of algorithms.
We were playing football on physical education. It was fun.
==December 22nd, 2021==
I passed the algorithms theory exam. Our homeroom teacher told us to stay around until the grades are known. We were waiting for 3 hours.
There was a dialogue:
Teacher:student1 3. Good enough?
Student1: yes.
Teacher: student2 4. Good enough?
Student2: Yes, it's great!
Teacher: Krasko 5. Good enough? Will you retake?
Me: perhaps, no.
==December 25th, 2021==
Our prefect (староста) decide to talk with Чайка. We have prepared candies, flowers and the envelope.
All the group came at 11 am to cough into the envelope (the exam was at 12 am). Prefect went to Чайка and... there were closed. She came a bit later, at 12:01.
Finally, he was along with the teacher. Prefer went out of the class, took a deep breath and ... threw flowers in the trash. After that he said: “We are in shit”.
Чайка said that we have a 2 hours and 15 minutes for exam. And the starting time was at 12:00 am (as a fact, 135 minutes is very little time to answer 5 complex questions and a practical assignment). She took out the phones. Also during the exam, she was looking under the desks, papers and checked the sleeves (рукава).
I passed Чайка's exam. I don't know what the results are. I answered all the questions, but not all of them were exhaustive (полные). She don't know when the grades will be known.
Remark: I got 5.
==December 27th, 2021==
I had my last exam today. I got 5. I also wrote my deskmate's variant in full. He got 4. However, today I forgot to take the important document for recruitment office from my technical school. So tomorrow I have to go there.

Today was a really bad traffic. I spend a lot of time for this bumf. I left at 9:45 and came back at 14:30.
==December 30th, 2021==
Today I was in the Quest room. The name of the room was “contagion”. There was an actor. We were allowed to play on the middle difficulty (actor could touch us). If he did it (touch us), we were infected and had to use first-aid kits that were found earlier.
We should solve a riddles to escape. There were a lot of rooms and doors so we can't be sure where the actor will appear next time. One of us quit the room because of fear.
In this room was the best decorations and the actor choose the right moments to appear. He really scared me two times.
It was fun.

### January 
==January 9th, 2022==
Holidays end soon. I can't fulfill all my plans. However, it's not a failure. I have done a lot of useful things and, what is the most important, I gained confidence. Now I know the direction to move. I feel that I am changing, there is a progress.
Today I was in the market (рынок). We lost a lot of time there. I got home at 1 pm.
I got the schedule. We will have Russian (without exam). Also we have a lot of stuff subjects.
We can do a lesson on Monday at 19:30-21:00.
==January 11th, 2022==
Today I passed a medical examination at the military office. It took too long. I get home only at 4:30 pm.
We had our phones taken away.I was kicking from the office to the another office. I met (познакомился) with a lot of new guys while we were in line (в очереди). Also I mastered a new skill. This master peace is using by a greatest psychologists to fully understand the health of person's phycology. You just need to look at his hands.
The worst thing is that I did not have enough analyzes. I have to get it and bring next week.
==January 12th, 2022==
Yesterday I forgot to say you one more thing. Before the medical examination we had a test. We almost went crazy while doing it. There were 6 intellectual test, 30 questions each, 2 tests with dictation of questions (72 and 165 questions) and 2 without dictation (60 and 45 questions). We had to answer yes or no. Many questions were repeated 5 or 6 times.
I got 5 for programming today. Also we had a lesson with Покотилова. Some students claimed (утверждали) that she was stricter than Чайка.
We entered the class and... there was nothing abnormal. We joke a lot, she had a good sense of humour.She hasn't shown her strict yet.
Also there was an interesting detail. She has a strange dialect. She makes mistakes in the endings of words and has some kind of aspirant (придых).Firstly, I thought that she was an English or German speaker, because she said that she had friends there. However, she said that she was an Ukrainian and Russian native speaker.
==January 13th, 2022==
Today I had English. For the next lesson I have to retell 1st text (geographical position ofGreat Britain) and learn words on the 2nd page.
English teacher don't know about olympics yet.
Today I got fluorography.
==January 14th, 2022==
Today I got cardiogram, uran and blood analysis. Also I managed to be in time for 2nd pair.
We can meet tomorrow, but I can't say exact time for sure. I will visit dantist on Saturday, perhaps.
==January 15th, 2022==
When I was examined at the military office, I was told that I had problems with my teeth. I decided to fix that and went to children dentistry. I spent a lot of time to get there.
They asked me to show my passport and ... said that I need an adult with me. So I am old enough to call me in the army, but not enough to treat my teeth!?
==January 17th, 2022==
Today we got a new subject. Our teacher is about 25. However, if someone told me that this is my new classmate, I wouldn't doubt even for a second.He looks like a guy 16-18 years old.
He turned out to be a good teacher, he explains material well. Also he sympathizedwith us, when he found out that we had Чайка and Dudkevich (physics).
He told us about his experience as a system administrator in МВД. They used a 20GB drive from the previous century as their main database. They put up icons so it wouldn't break. Also there were cameras attached (прикрепленный) to the wall with plasticine. Sometimes they asked him to fix garland (гирлянду) and even aquarium.
On Saturday I have to go to the math olympiad.
We can make a lesson today at 19:30-21:00.
==January 18th, 2022==
Today we were in a museum. However, actually we just was in the building of museum. We used it as a performance hall. We just lessened to reports on the topic “Battle against attempts to change the history of World War II”.
After that we went back to studying.
==January 20th, 2022==
Today I got 5 for English words, 5 for retell and 5 for work in class. I need to learn new words for next lesson and retell other 3 texts sometime (I think it will be good to retell the following text for next lesson).
And about the conference... I won't be able to participate. Our teacher had a failure. The confidence will be in April, however we had to check in (зарегистрироваться) before 1st December.
==January 21st, 2022==
Today I had a 5th double lesson (2-5) .
I have to go to math Olympics tomorrow. It will be at 12:00. We can made a lesson on Sunday at 9 am.
Today we had a lesson with teacher who was telling us about his system administrator experience (his last name isМунистр). He is 21. His subject is technical media (технические средства информации).
We had an interesting lesson with him. He is a good teacher. We (I and the teacher) were discussing the topic of computer system architecture. He said that Чайка did a good job.
I took two topics for reports (доклада). One of them is “M1 max (processor's name) architecture”. It's a very interesting theme for me.
He also gifted me book by him. It's called “Network on Chip”. He also wrote many other books and articles.
==January 22nd, 2022==
Today I participated in the Olympics. I left home at 9 am and will be back home about 5 pm. I got sertificate and gratitude for the teacher. There were difficult tasks, but there were also easy ones.
By the way I got a beautiful manicure on the way to Olympics. One woman hit me on the fingers with the door. It was my working hand, but I still was able to write.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.41.47 2.png|500]]
I don't know why is this happen, but a few minutes after I got hit, It became hard for me to breath, my legs was shaking, my head began to spin and my vision was blurry. Maybe it was a panic attack? But why did it happen?
==January 24th, 2022==
Today I slept well. Also I got 5 for technical media. I had 3 double lessons today. There was nothing interesting today.
There are too much words "today"in today's note...
==January 25th, 2022==
I got 5 for subject “business economics (экономика предприятия)”. Also we had math test. Math teacher asked me to participate in the distance team competition. Tomorrow we have 2-5 double lessons.
==January 27th, 2022==
I had English lesson today. I got 5 for words, for retelling and for class work.
Operating systems teacher told us a funny story:
Student: can you let me out of class (отпустить с урока)?
Teacher: what happened?
Student: my phone run out of battery.
==January 28th, 2022==
I had math Olympics yesterday. I have solved 20 questions. I spend all the day for that.
Today math teacher took me from second lesson to solve more questions together (we give one blank from the education institution). We solve a few questions during this lesson.
After that, math teacher said that I can stay if I wish. I decided to go for a double lesson.
In the very beginning of the third lesson math teacher called me and said that I DO want to go to Olympics.
The fourth lesson was math. After a half of the lesson we did all the tasks.
There were too many tasks with critical errors (I used this word on purpose). It was a horrible Olympics.
We are not in quarantine yet.
==January 31st, 2022==
Yesterday I had a lot of homework for today. I had to finish the lessons at night. Also I had to prepare report for technology media. I did a good job, because I think wewill explain our material to the class. However, we wasn't.
Today I had to take the charter for the Olympiad at 1 pm.I had to go for it instead of 3rd and 4th lessons.However, on the 2nd pair, we were told that our classmate had covid and we were going into quarantine for a week.Everyone went home, but I was still obliged to go for the charter .
### February 
==February 1st, 2022==
Today I was in military office and in dentistry. I went with my father in a car. He had a lot of business in the city. I had to get to the dentist at 2:15 pm.
We left the house at 11 am. My father left me at military office and went for his business. I got the paper, but it was unexpectedly quick. Therefore I had to wait an hour and a half.
I was said that I need 5 fillings (пломб). Today the doctor started to treat my 1st tooth.
==February 7th, 2022==
Today was an ordinary day. I had an interesting discussion with Мунистер (about computer memory).
We can make a lesson today 19:30-21:00.
==February 8th, 2022==
Today I got 5 for programming. Also one girl from our group brought guitar and played L’s theme and a few other tunes.
I have to go for dantist on Thursday. I have an appointment at 9:30. I will be absent at first two lessons for sure. I have English at third double lesson. Will I be at time? I don't know.
==February 9th, 2022==
I got 5 for programming. Also we had a class hour today. It was a completely common day.
We can do a lesson today at 20:00.
==February 10th, 2022==
Today I went to the dantist. My appointment was at 9:30. Today the dantist removed nerves from my tooth. The doctor did not use painkillers. My tooth is still not cured.
I left the hospital at 11:30 (the third lesson starts at 11:20). I received a medical certificate. There was no point in going to school.
The next appointment will be on Thursday at 15:15
==February 15th, 2022==
Today I was at the dantist. Last time she said it would be fast, but it wasn't. I will be home about 6:45 pm.
Anyway, I have no right to blame her. Her shift (смена) was until 4 pm and even so she worked high quality. She took apicture of my tooth twice to be sure about the job. She also worked on my byte and worried about appearance. At the end she even gave me a mirror to boast.
I took a look at wooordhunt dictionary. It is comfortable for us to move words between folders. However, there isn't any word learning system, we can't choose specific sentence or collocation, add our own words (which is not in the dictionary), attach any kind of stuff (pictures) to the word.
### March
==March 6th, 2022==
I had a big plans for today. However, there was two unexpected events today: my sister and nephew visited us and I was playing with my friends. {: (_ and _ =) and (...)}(what should we do with punctuation?).
I didn't manage with all my plans. However, I had normal amount of work, a lot of rest and entertainment, not procrastination (of course, it was, but less than usually).
I'm still very dissatisfied with the result, but anyway, it wasn't a complete failure.
==March 8th, 2022==
That's a story from my childhood.
One time my brother and I found ink in grandmother’s cabinet. We went to our room and decided to draw something.
Of course, we decided that the best place to paint would be a carpet and, with no doubts, using a regular piece of paper would be a good idea. We didn’t have brushes so we decided to use the ink as watercolor (акварель). We soon realized that all the paper was wet and there was a big spot on the carpet. My older brother asked me to guard the door while he was trying to came up with something.
My grandmother passed by and I told her not to come into our room. Of course, she did it. She was terrified. I said that spot dripped from the ceiling. She was stanned for a moment and then laughted a bit. She helped us to clean the carpet (as good as it was possible).
We weren’t killed for this.
==March 12th, 2022==
Today I had a productive morning, an English lesson.However, after that I made many mistakes again.It's 6 pm now.I understand that I will not be able to realize all my plans for today, so I made a decision.
Today, from now on, I will not use devices, I will not do anything else from the topic of productivity.I will spend the rest of the day to be alone with myself.
==March 16th, 2022==
Today I had a good day. I was productive, rested a lot and was playing with my friends.
Of course this day is far from being perfect, but I feel good about myself today. I hope that I will be able to do even better in future days.
### April 
==April 3rd, 2022==
Today I again failed to do everything as it was necessary. However, tomorrow I will do everything right (with each new time, pronouncing this phrase without a smile becomes more difficult).
Here are the stats for today:
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.44.04 1.png|500]]
==April 20th, 2022==
Today I had a good day.
I woke up on time, worked out, read a book, did my normal amount of homework, and went out with my friends. And, what is more important, I almost haven't consumed informational noise today.
I will try to improve my progress.
==April 21st, 2022==
Today I failed. I overslept, for a long time I could not begin to act. In the middle of the day, I too was often distracted and violated my principles.
I did almost nothing today.
==April 22nd, 2022==
Today I overslept and could not start the day for a long time. However, thanks to the second part of the day and the first half of the night, I did almost everything I planned. 
==April 24th, 2022==
I overslept and didn’t do as many work as I wanted. My friend had a birthday today. I didn’t have a solid ground to have fun, I had to do a lot of things. However, I allowed myself to do so.
My friends came to me. They took with them cake and junk food. My sister and nephew also came to visit us.
At first we played billiards and trained. After that we played football. All of a sudden my sister released the dog and we started playing doggie (several players pass the ball between themselves to prevent the "doggie" from taking it(ball)) with my dog. There was a few funny moments (I’ll send you a video). Next I took a few pictures with my dog. And the last thing we did was watch stupid videos while eating cake and junk food.
I want you to get my idea. 
I really want to enjoy my life, but that is the key to why I blame myself so much. This day was really fun. Such memories are material, they will feed me with emotions for a long time. I don’t regret about the time I spend on these events, but what I do regret is the circumstances in which I met these events.
Anime, manga, games and other informational noise (in most cases): as soon as we return to the real world, we understand that time has gone, gone along with the emotions that we had 5 minutes ago. All we have left are regrets.
This is the reason why I want to change my mindset. I want to be productive so that I can face moments of material emotion without regret. I want to really manage my time, own it. I want to always be able to create the conditions for my happiness.
P.S: I'm not saying that emotions from the consumption of non-living information cannot be material. I’m just saying that we need to be able to give ourselves an account of our emotions.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.45.37.png|500]]
==April 26th, 2022==
Today I again betrayed my expectations (was there anyone doubting this outcome?). Also today there was no light and therе ware heavy shelling. I hope that tomorrow I can do everything right.
==April 28th, 2022==
There was no light for most of the day.However, I had a good job.It was far from ideal, but I am pleased with today's work.Anyway, I don't know if there will be light tomorrow, so I'll have to do some tasks tonight (some tasks can't be done without a computer).

### May
==May 7th, 2022==
Today I overslept and did not fulfill the daily plan.In any case, tomorrow I will try to do everything right.
By the way, when we played with the ball today, a military man joined us.
==May 10th, 2022==
Today I had a productive day. I finally got back to my programming course and finished reading a book about processors. I also minimized the information noise.
I hope that I will not worsen the performance tomorrow.
==May 11th, 2022==
Today I also managed to do a normal amount of work. However, in the morning my mother prepared a surprise for me. She had an event at work and had to prepare the music. However, the music turned out to be broken (mother did not check it beforehand). I had to find music myself and bring a flash drive to her on a bicycle. 
 
Today I went to the dentist. This tooth didn’t take as long as the last one, it's already fixed. The next appointment to the doctor on Monday.
==May 30th, 2022==
Today I went to dentist. This tooth took more time than previous, but it's already fixed. I have fixed 3 tooth from 5.
My dentist is very fundamental (принципиальный) to her work. She worked on the appearance of the tooth several times, even after I said that it looks great. She goes on vocation and the following teeth I will do after 20th.
### June
==June 12th, 2022==
Today we had guests: my sister and her family and a family of my friends. We were playing football, computer games, etc. We ate fried meat, different sweets and salads.
My nephew decided to stay with us (sister went home). There was a funny situation when my sister threatened to leave him here for a month and he was not against it. I helped him wash and prepared a place to sleep.
==June 30th, 2022==
Today I went to dantist. She cured one tooth and began to treat the second (the last one). However, she found this tooth to be problematic. She promised to fix this one at Wednesday.
### July
==July 6th, 2022==
Finally, today I fixed my last tooth. This one was hard, the dantist had to remove the nerves. On the way, I added images for Anki. 
==July 13th, 2022==
I am still in Rostov. For my surprise these two days was quite productive, I did a lot more work than usual.
Today I was at sea, and then in the castle in Azov. I can send you some photo if you are interested. It took about 7 hours. Even so, this day was very productive. I studied programming, 3d modeling, touch typing, read, was studying articles, training, editing photos and even transfer some words into anki.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.47.08.png|500]]
==July 14th, 2022==
Most of this day I was on my way to the Crimea. My father has mobile internet. Thanks for that I was capable to work during the travel. This day was also productive.
Today I won't be able to get to Crimea. We will be there about 2 am.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.47.49.png|500]]
==July 16th, 2022==
Today, and the day before I also managed to do a lot of work. I still working on Anki. Also in these two days I wrote an article “Duality of Individualization”. It’s a short one, but there is some sort of interest information. We can start translating it in the next lesson.
==July 17th, 2022==
Comic situation:
Father drinking something orange (obviously it's beer).
Grandmother: is it apple juice?
Father (sarcastically): Yeeees… It… is
 __pause__ 
 __Grandma starts yelling at my father because she thinks he drank all the juice her friend gave her. The father tries to explain, but the grandmother doesn’t listen.__ 
==July 18th, 2022==
Today we were in the city. Grandma bought me a T-shirt and took us to a restaurant. My grandmother and dad told that my tea tastes better than the restaurant one.
The fun story:
Someone called my grandmother. It was some kind of spam. My granny was told that she won the money. And… my grandmother said them to give this money for children house. Also she started her story about other cases when she won money. It lasted for 10 minutes. He wasn't glad that she phoned her.
==July 19th, 2022==
Today we were at sea. Also my father took us in чебуречная. We didn’t manage to eat everything and took the food home. I can send you some photos from cafe If you want.
==July 21st, 2022==
Today we were at sea.In recent days I started to take more information noise and wasn't that productive as I used to. However I'll do my best to break out of this problem.
Today I started working on my new article “The Duality of Being Human. Individual and Freedom.” (I am not quite sure about the title).
==July 23rd, 2022==
Today we were at sea. However, water was really cold, so I swam quite a little.
Today I started writing new article “The Duality of Being Human. Individual and Freedom” (I am not quite sure about the title).
==July 24th, 2022==
Today I was editing а photo for my friend. He liked it. I wrote part of the article, but I found interesting information on my topic. So I will stop writing the article for a short time.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.48.23.png|500]]
==July 25th, 2022==
I have noticed one interesting thing.There is one game. It’s name is “правда или действие”. the Russian name says that you are obliged to perform an action. Therefore, disputes often arise.
However, the English version says otherwise. "Truth or Dare" is the English title. Dare to be brave enough to do something difficult or dangerous or that you should not do. In other word it’s a challenge. This title gives much more sense than the Russian one.
==July 26th, 2022==
Today is my father's birthday. We fried meat and ordered cake. I still not quite sure about the article.
Here is the photos of cake:
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.48.57.png|500]]
==July 30th, 2022==
For several days now, my grandmother has not been feeling well. We wanted to take her to the hospital, but she didn't. Today we managed to take her there. Her lungs are 68% affected. We were not told what she was sick with, she was put in intensive care.
### August 
==August 1st, 2022==
The health of my grandmother going up, but she still in the hospital.
Today I cooked a soup. I didn’t know that beef need a lot of time time to became soft. Anyway, it was eatable.
==August 4th, 2022==
I find an interesting expression: snack well. it names the situation when person eats more food that he needed just because the food is low-calorie. it happens due to believing that he eats something healthy (for example, diet cookies) 
This is the meaning, however I won't explain the wordplay. I hand over this task to you. 
==August 6th, 2022==
Today I have finished my work on 3d donut. Next I am going to do decor for Nikita's channel.
Today I did normal amount of work. Also I moved the main parts of my parts of my database to remnote, however I still have a lot to do.
==August 7th, 2022==
I have finished my 3d donut.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.49.30.png|500]]
==August 12th, 2022==
About 2 weeks my grandma was in the hospital. Today, all of the sudden, she was going home (as I understand it, she had argue with doctors. She has diabetes, but she against a strict diet. Thanks to that doctors decided to send her home). We wasn't ready for such circumstances. Due to that we was doing cleaning all the day (she was home about 5 pm).
Happy Birthday, LD! I wish you all the best. Especially, I wish you success in struggling with stress!
==August 14th, 2022==
Today I wake up at night. I couldn't sleep. Suddenly, I realized that I was sick (меня тошнило). It wasn't a pleasant night for me. I have managed to fall asleep about 6:30 am. All the day I felt myself weak.
==August 15th, 2022==
Today we were working hard. I dug out trees and cut roses. Tommorow we'll move to home. 
 ![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.49.57.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.50.07.png]]
==August 16th, 2022==
We left at 6:45. Now I'm in Rostov. We'll sleep here at go home at the morning. Our way tool a lot of time thanks for the traffic jams.
### December 
==December 14th, 2022==
It was a great day. For the first time in a long time I am happy with the way I spent the day. I woke up at 5am, had a shower, did a pet service. Right after that I had a breakfast and started my homework. At 11am I had done the same amount of work, that I usually do in the whole day (On Wednesday I wrote 3 lectures and 1 practical task for Friday). After that I played with dog, had a workout, dine, helped my mom, talked with my grandmother.Also I got an information about examination. I got the card for my examination, but I needed to send it until Friday. I solved everything from card and send it. At the end I had a lesson with LD. By the way, I also got a phone call from my preference that told me, that I got auto grade for another examination.
==December 20th, 2022==
Today I was unbelievable productive. I have done 10 homeworks, when the usual number is about 4. However, I don't think it's the right form of productivity. All day I was working almost without rest, I believe there should be some space for it too.
==December 21st, 2022==
Today my father and me going to Crimea to visit my grandmother.
I wake up at 5, quickly had a breakfast and gather my stuff together. We left the flat at 5:40. Our car was erasing the distance quickly. At 14:20 we find ourselves being one step from the bridge (Crimea bridge, obviously). However, one problem surfaced: for some reason bridge was closed until 18:00.
So here we are, waiting for the nightfall.
==December 29th, 2022==
For my surprise, the last few days were really great (except lessons with the teacher, because of the awful internet connection). I was programming a lot (compare to the previous few month),reading books, practicing typing, writing essays and even manage to find the sports field in the city to train. 
==December 30th, 2022==
Today is the day of heading home. We set off at 11:45, at 13:30 we get to the boundary. Today, the 30th of December, among all possible days, is the day when we cross the boundary in the shortest time. It took about 15 minutes?! Estimated time of arrival is 3:45pm.
# 2023
### January 
==January 7th, 2023==
To be honest, there is no way I could be proud about the way I spend all of the days of the new year. I spoiled most of the time so far, but still, I'm trying to look forward positive. Today I had a lot of fun eating sushi and taking photos with my sensei, nephew and other people.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.53.19.png|500]]
==January 23rd, 2023==
Today I was lazy all day. The first half I spend watching some anime. After having dinner I was trying to do some work, but I couldn't find any will power for that. 

Therefore, I chose to fix the kitchen tap as an interesting form of procrastination. For some reason, water was not able to go away from the sink. I took apart some pipes, but it appears that plug drew itself in the pipe that was behind the heavy furniture. I clean it as good as it was possible without moving the objects. I assemble everything and water got the path. 

After that I walked with the dog, but still was not able to force myself to do the homework. With that in mind I fixed the tap in the bathroom (this one was much easier). Right after that I spend some time with my friends, had a training, write one lecture (which was not nearly enough) and had a lesson with LD.
==January 24th, 2023==
Today was another wasted day. I wrote 2 lectures, had a training, english lesson, played with dog and my friends. I surely did something, but it can not be called a good result. Tomorrow I'm 18, I don't give a big meaning for dates, but I really want to use it as an extra motivation to change my life.
==January 25th, 2023==
The half of this day I had no light. It was not a good affair for doing my homework. I was able to get some internet by using the accumulator, but it was not enough to charge my laptop. 
Today I wrote 1 lecture, had a training, played with the dog and my friends and had a lesson with LD. My mother cooked two salads and ordered pies (пирожные). 
I was not able to gather my will power today.
==January 26th, 2023==
Today I woke up at 5am, take a few sessions of meditation, wrote a lecture, had a training, complete the reading rate, spend some time working on the essay, walked with a dog, had a lesson with LD and did 2 practical works (one of them was quite hard, because there was no explanation at all). However, today I will have to fall asleep late.
It was not a bad day, but still there is a lot of space for improvement.
==January 29th, 2023==
Today I did some homework, more than usual, but I did not manage to do my reading rate. Also, for a long time, I am trying to get use to spend some stable amount of time during meditation, but I am constantly failing on this.
### February
==February 4th, 2023==
Today I was in the city. My mother bought a winter jacket for me. Also I have paid for the pressing racks. I will use it to learn handstand push-ups and full planche.
Also I have made a mistake during this trip. I forgot to take my documents. I could find quite a bit of troubles thanks to the military action.
==February 11th, 2023==
Yesterday I was doing Russian test for my mother. It was easy and I got 101 points out of 101. 
I am still doing the rest of my homework. I have to hurry up, because I have a practice task to do for Monday. I find chance of getting my homework done today (except English) to be possible.

==February 14th, 2023==
Today I fell asleep late. I woke up late as well, about 10am. However, today I had more self-discipline than usual: I had a cold shower, did the morning meditation, have been reading a book for 30 minutes, had a short session of meditation, have finished my first task for practise with a few short breaks, spend 2 hours playing with friends, cleared the snow, chopped wood and had a lesson with LD. Now am going to do another session of meditation and go to bed.
### March
==March 22nd, 2023==
Today is the last day of the application programming practice. I have already send all the tasks. At this point all the debt I have are 2 homework assignments and I can't even say that they are important ones.
Tomorrow is the start of the new practise and this time I'm going to do everything right. 
For the last days I was practicing meditation with more effort than usually. I use a program to track my time. My current steak is 48 days (you need to have no less than 2 meditation per a day). However, my average time is 9 min per a day, it makes 8 hours and 42 minutes of meditation within 48 days.
### April
==April 5th, 2023==
Today I was in Donetsk. I left home at 8:45 am. I had four things to do in the city. First of all, I hand over the necessary documents to my classroom teacher. After that I asked for some other documents in the human resources department, however, these documents will be ready on Friday. With this in mind I will have to visit Donetsk again. After this I bought a few things for my mother and discount some money from my student card. I will be home around 12:30 am.
==April 7th, 2023==
Today I had paid a visit to Donetsk with my dad on his car. We left at 8:45am. I got the necessary documents, bought some things for my mother and helped with shopping. It took more time than I was waiting for. As fact, I would be at home if I decided to go by bus.
However, on top of all that, something have happened with a wheel. We had to visit tire (шиномонтаж) immediately. There was not much help out of me at that situation, I decided to go home by the bus. I would be at home around 2pm.
==April 13th, 2023==
During the last few days (except yesterday) I was working hard, however, I have overestimate my abilities quite a lot, I won't make it in time. Most of the work has been a perfectly new experience for me, it took much more time than I hoped. However, teacher did not checked any homework for the last two weeks, so I still have some chances to get an acceptable grade (5).
Anyway, I have a lot of work ahead and still can not guaranty, that I will be able to take a lesson with LD tomorrow.
==April 15th, 2023==
I got the grade for the project that I was doing for the last three weeks. I was not able to complete this project, I overestimated my abilities, however, I still got 5. Anyway, I'm going to finish this project in my free time (if I will have some). I have learned a lot during this work and have a lot to learn to life it completely, moreover I will be able to use this project as my diploma one.
==April 18th, 2023==
A few days ago one event have happened with Hanter. That morning I fed and closed him in the cage. Right after that he started growling at me, he was trembling. Immediately I bring this information to my parents. The dog was growling at my father as well. We were scared that it could be rabies (бешенство). 

Vet said that it was not the case, but we still needed to check his temperature, there was a chance of him being infected with something else. We wore thick clothes and came to Hanter, he was positive. I let him out. He laid on his back and wanted us to pet him. 

My father started giving him pets, the dog was happy. However, suddenly, he turn angry and bit my dad a few times with the serious intention of harming him. I threw some food for the dog to distract him and my father run into the house. Right after this I closed Hanter in the cage (he was not aggressive towards me).
My father did get a bruise, but the dog was not able to bite through the clothes. Obviously, we weren't gonna measure his temperature anymore, moreover, the idea of getting rid of Hanter slipped into consideration.

Vet said that the dog was after getting the leadership over my father and that it was normal behaviour for his age. It was not the kind of explanation that could ease us, the vase of trust in the dog was crushed into pieces.

Talking about now, Hanter's behaviour is normal, he obeys my commands and shows no aggression. The vase was put back together, but nothing can heal the cracks (pretend as if it was some kind of tolerable analogy).
==April 21st, 2023==
Yesterday I got an invitation to the English olympic. This competition has an international status. During the test, I will have to undertake a few ordeals: dictionary, speaking, reading and listening.
Sure, it would be hard, but I find this situation to be a great motivator. Let's face it and get as much useful experience as we can.
==April 22nd, 2023==
Yesterday I got an phone call. It was one teacher from university, he has 43 years of work experience and doctor degree. His name is Michail Dmitrievich He asked for my help in creating one project. 
The teacher wants us to get a grant worth of 1,5 million rubles and use this money to develop his project. The team consists of 4 people: 2 adults (including Michail Dmitrievich)and 2 teenagers. 10% of the money will be taken by university, 15% will be spend on business trips. 
The purpose of the project is to make a chat bot, that will help teachers to create learning programs.
However, this is possible only in case if we will get this grant. The end of registration is in June. If we receive a grant, the work will start in November. 
Until that time I have to learn by his methods.

### May
==May 15th, 2023==
I had a few lessons in the morning, right after that I headed to the passport office. I got all the necessary documents, copies of documents and other items (pen, folder, paper, etc). I was there at 11:40 am. For my surprise, there was a system of the line (it was a pathetic one, but thanks to it I was able to take a lunch break).
About 2pm I came to realisation: I forgot photos. I was scared that all this waiting was for nothing. However, almost everything worked out. I got a coupon for submission of documents for tomorrow. I will have to skip my classes and spend some time on this tomorrow, but it should be faster than today. 
==May 23rd, 2023==
Today I got a phone call about my passport. It has been completed (they did all the work within one week).
I reserved this call about 2:10pm and was in a toss-up between trying to get it before 4pm today and getting it tomorrow. I choose the first option (nothing motivates you to save time as much as dead line) and managed to pull this off.
A few days before our teacher told us that we are going to bring ourselves to school in the next semester. With this in mind I bought some new clothes on the way home.
==May 29th, 2023==
Today I went to city to bring my course work to my classroom teacher. On the way there, I brought a new costume for myself (maybe I will send you some photos later). Other than that, there was nothing special.
I got home only around 3pm. There are a lot of reasons for that. Let's start with the fact that I left home around 11:11 am. I was planning to do it way earlier, however, I did not feel myself good at the morning, I was weak. As well I spend a lot of time for different stuff.
### June
==June 15th, 2023==
About 2 mounth ago I got a test to prove my skills for Mihael Geogievich, I had to create a big project. 7 weeks passed with no work and in the nearest time I had to pitch my project.
Today was the day. I spent a few last days and nights to catch up (наверстать упущенное), I was mostly ready. There was still a lot of space for improvement, but generally speaking, the teacher was satisfied.
Talking about myself, I am inspired. I want to change, I'm will change. I want to be disciplined, but I don't regret about past, I accept it.
==June 19th, 2023==
Review of the book "**Куда бы ты ни шел — ты уже там.** Джон Кабат-Зинн".
There were a lot of details about the philosophy of meditation, being present, accepting things as they are now (However, the last topic was not discussed as fully as I wanted it to be). This book will be especially helpful for beginners.
It is a good book, but for me there are two big problems. The first one is about how swallow was the part about practice instructions and the second one is the size of the book, this information did not worth 192 pages.
==June 24th, 2023==
Today, as every other day, I had a walk with Hunter, however, when I got home, I was not able to find my phone (It was with me during the walk).
I searched in every place where I could possible left it, but there were no result. I gave a call at my phone a few times, I was unable to find it. Suddenly, someone answered the phone. I was not able to understand the meaning of the words, mobile communication was quite bad, but I could say for sure, that it was a stranger. He ended the call...
I give a shot for a few another calls, but there were no answer. I remembered that at that day I happen to run into two mеn on the narrow path. For some reason, Hunter was scared of them. I was afraid that they could have stolen the phone.
Finally, someone picked up the phone. The stranger said that he would return the phone, but he is far away and he will be able to pay me a visit tomorrow. Let's see if he keeps his promise.
==June 25th, 2023==
I did not get my phone back yet.
Today I had a lesson with LD. We spend a lot of time talking about Vagabond. Talking about every chapter takes quite a lot of time, however it helps me to understand the story more profound. I guess, that in the nearest time I will try to start my preparation for Bojack.
==June 27th, 2023==
Today I was supposed to have a lesson with LD, however, about 11 am the light was turned off. I still did not get my phone back, so I could not use it to call LD or to use mobile internet,my mother was on the work, so I couldn't use her phone as well. When she was back it was around 16:30 and I decided to not distract LD, because I would not be able to do a lot without internet and with laptop running out of energy.
After I did everything, that could be done without internet, I decided to sleep, so I would be able to be up when we will got some electricity.
==June 28th, 2023==
I have already done all of the homework, now I'm waiting to get automatic score for my exams as I was promised.
Finally I have some time for lot of business, that I was putting off for a long time. I will spend more time learning programming and doing exercises for my posture, as well I will resume work on speed typing, diction and my essays.
### July
==July 3rd, 2023==
Today I was in the city. The purpose of my trip was writing a statement to the police. As a side quest I got a request for my mother, she wanted me to get a coupon for residence registration.
My brother gave me his phone, so I could do something while I'm in line.
When I was in the bus, I found out that I have forgotten my mother's documents (I only needed information from it). There was no sim card in this phone, because of that I was not able to call someone or use mobile internet.
It took a lot of time, but I managed to find a free wi-fi. Thanks to it I got all the necessary information.
I got to the police office and have them all information about the affair with my phone. They decided that was not stealing. I wrote a statement about missing my phone, but they said that I shouldn't have given this high hopes.
After that, I was waiting on line to get the coupon for my mother, but it was not possible, they needed to take a photo of her face, she had to be there personally.
==July 4th, 2023==
Review of the book
I got quite a lot of useful information. I will for sure have to get back to this book a few times to get used to all technics that this book has offered me.
For example, I liked the idea about being interested rather than trying to be interesting. Basically, it mean that you should listen closely to people around you, everyone wants to be heard. If you will be able to be invested in the conversation with the person, then it will bring him joy and satisfaction, you will interest him way more this way.
==July 6th, 2023==
Today is the second day without internet. For these two days I had no lessons with LD. I was trying to contact my English teacher, but I was not able to do that.
Throughout my life I grew some confidence in my ability to stay calm and be in the sober mind under influence of stress. That confidence of mine have matured quite a lot thanks to the grow of my spiritual development in the latest time. 
However, when I lost my phone, I find some weaknesses in my abilities. I made some conclusions and put some work to become stronger.
Today, once again, my confidence was shattered, the very thought of loosing so much time was unbearable for me. I have so much hopes for this summer, but here I am, finding out that I would have to spend big piece of it to find a company to do my school practice in. On top of that I had no means of doing the most important parts of learning thanks to the lack of internet, my brother was doing his best to turn me mad just out of boredom, my mother was having some problems due to the lack of internet and was asking me to help in the way that would take an awful amount of time. 
I would never think that such a pathetic problems could upset me so much. I guess, I have a lot of space for improvement.
==July 9th, 2023==
I was planning to do a lot of studying before we start our trip, however, I didn't. I was way to worried about lot of other things, such as preparing my clothes, documents, cables, laptop, spending time with Hunter and just thinking about various stuff.
We crossed the board quite quick, in under 15 minutes. After that I felt asleep, I was always get carsick (укачивает) in transport.
Today, on the way to the apartment, I bought a new phone for myself. After a little lunch I prepared a workspace and started my learning.
We can start a lesson tomorrow in any time, that will be comfortable to you.
==July 12th, 2023==
We got to bridge at 11:30pm. At first, my father decided to rest and sleep before crossing the bridge, however, he was not able to fell asleep.
After we crossed the bridge, my father finally succeed in sleeping, we all were sleeping until 4:30 am. After that we continued our way, however, I had no mobile internet and my laptop had no energy, so I was sleeping for the rest of the way. 
We successfully got to my grandmother at 9:30am.
==July 13th, 2023==
Today we were doing a lot of work in the garden. I was working mainly with pruner (секатор). Roses and weeds around them were my main target. I took some pictures of out work:
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.55.43 1.png|500]]![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.55.54.png|500]] ![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 18.56.06.png|500]]
==July 14th, 2023==
I have found one interesting site for learning words. Basically, it's a goodenglish to english dictionary with synonyms, examples from books, different forms and meanings of the word. 
However, what caught my attention is how their system of learning words works. You can find a word in the dictionary, quickly add it to the list and the best thing is that you don't need to do any extra work, this site will create exercises with those words automatically. You will get exercises with looking for examples, filling gaps, spelling words and other ones. What is even more exiting, is that you will get different exercises for the same words, so you will learn more ways to use it. As a bonus, we will get an interesting system of contests with other learners.
However, on the free version, we will be able to learn only one list at a time, but I think, that we can work with that. There are other interesting features, but they are available only of the subscription version.
==July 16th, 2023==
Today we paid a visit to the sea. In previous years I was there many times, but this one is a bit different.
During this year I have experienced a lot about rest and meditation, thanks to that I was able to take this situation differently, I enjoyed it way more then I used to do.
==July 19th, 2023==
I had a need to get one document (СНИЛС). My father told me, that he would take me at the right place when he goes to the city next time.
At first, we agreed to the Friday (14.07), however, this trip was postponed a few times. The situation changed and my father no longer had any business there, it was decided that I would go there by bus with my brother.
Primary, my brother was with me because he knew the way to that place, however, it appeared, that he was not as good at knowing the bus schedule, as we thought.
We ended up crossing 5 km of land on our feet to get to the bus station and waiting for the bus for an hour only to realize, that we would have to wait there for another 90 minutes. From my calculations, we would be at home around 4:30 pm if we were using buses.
We decided to give up, however, I still got this document, because my father decided to make a huge circle and get me there on the way to the sea.
==July 23rd, 2023==
My father and brother left Crimea on July 20. I stayed here to look after my grandmother.
Yesterday my sister and her husband got to Crimea to visit Alina (the name of my grandmother). 
Today all of us went to see. On the beach we bought some food and spend some time swimming and just doing nothing. It was a great rest for me.
==July 24th, 2023==
I can not say that during last few days I was learning a lot, as well I can not say that I did nothing. 
I am quite sure, that if I would be at such state a shot period of time before, I would consider this to be a failure, but I don't take it this way now, I'm even happy. I changed a lot, I have different values now, and I hope, that I will continue to move at this direction.
Today I was in akuapark with my sister and her husband. I decided to leave my phone at the car. At this park we were using attractions, eating local food and swimming at the pool. It was really fun, I enjoyed it a lot.
When we left the place, we found out that our car was taken on the parking fine (штрафная стоянка). We spend a lot of time to get the car back, I was not able to do any notes or read any books during this process.
For some reason, today I was able to embrace the reality this time, I even was able to rest and enjoy this time. 
Of course, I can not say for sure, how strong or flexible I'm right now, after all, my current life obstacles are just way too comfortable and merciful to judge on their basis, however, I can say for sure, that past me would not only take this situation as a stressful waste of time, but as well I would not be able to take a good rest at aquapark.
==July 26th, 2023==
Today, once again, I was on the sea with my sister and herhusband. 
This time we visited other beach. I was on this one long time ago. Back then I thought that this beach is worse than other one, because on this one there is a need to cross a large park to get to the sea. However, this visit gave me other impression, I found out for myself that this park is really beautiful (I'll send you photos letter). This time I was able to enjoy this walk.
On the sea were strong wind and large waves. Swimming was forbidden, but I enjoyed my time there anyway.
Today is my father's birthday, but I guess, that I will talk about it later.
==July 27th, 2023==
I need to confirm my account of government services (гос. услуги) as soon as possible. I have such a need for learning purposes in school.
That's why today I decided to visit bank (it is a necessary condition for confirming an account). However, this trip was not successful, It appeared that I need a Russian sim-card for that.
After that, we went to the sea. This time waves were even stronger, but I enjoyed this time anyway.
We were on the same beach as yesterday, I found that park to be even more fabulous that I did yesterday. However, one detail was surprising to me: toilet in the park is not free, even when the park itself is completely free. It is just funny that they are spending a extremely lot of money to keep large park in a good condition, but they are not willing to spend a bit more for the toilet.
### August
==August 5th, 2023==
My father and brother got to Crime on August 2nd.
Today we were on the sea. It was quite an unexpected proposal. I even had to postpone a lesson with LD and my other activities. 
Of course, I know, that it is not the best way of handling my schedule, however, It is really hard to negotiate about something stable with my relatives.
Anyway, I did my best to enjoy this time.
==August 6th, 2023==
More than a mouth has passed since the beginning of my holiday. I had a huge plans for this summer. 
What can I say about this time?... How is it going? Well... it is complicated. At one hand, I had some unrealistic expectations, I have no chance to meat them. On the other hand, I am doing well, sure, my progress and the way how I manage my energy is not great in any means, however, I'm still doing way better, than during my few other summers, and, what is even more important, I have a lot of success in other directions, that I did not anticipated, especially when it comes to my spiritual development.
In the end there are still big part of reality that is way too hard for me to embrace, however, at least consсiously, I know how things should be, where I should move. 
I'll do my best.
==August 7th, 2023==
A few weeks ago I was invited to one course by my classroom teacher. This course started today.
The information of the lessons itself were not interesting, however, there was one really interesting moment. This lesson was going in live and there was a guy who was translating the teacher on English.
This detail made this lesson way more interesting, I could entertain myself by looking for mistakes in his speech and translation. I record a few parts from lessons for you.
Maybe, on the next time I will try to ask some questions in English.
==August 8th, 2023==
Today was another day of that course. Today's lessons were even longer, then in the last time. I record some of them, but I did not ask any questions.
Yesterday I had a lot of doubts about this course, I was not sure if I am able to go through all the tasks, however, this lessons left me without any doubts. Now I'm sure... there is no way for me to show a good result. The topics of this course are way too far away from my speciality, I have never worked with this programs, artificial intelligence or GitHub, I have no idea why my teacher send me there.
Anyway, I will just accept things as they are, lower my expectation and just do everything that is possible within my powers.
==August 9th, 2023==
Today, once again, I had online classes. I received a homework, a lot of it, however, this assignment was different from what I expected (that task was for winners of Olympics). 
Sure, I will have to spend a lot of time and efforts to complete it and, as well, I have a deadline tomorrow at 12 am, however, I will be able to complete it.
Today I also had to pay a visit to the passport office. My visit was successful.
==August 12th, 2023==
For the last few days I was giving quite a bit piece of my energy and time to a new course, that my classroom teacher wrote me into, and, to be honest, It is hard to tell, what was squeezing (выжимать) me harder, the course itself or my expectation about hardships that it would bring me in the near futute.
Anyway, now, when I got some free time from it, I have a strong inspiration, now I can learn whatever I want. I guess, that such times helps us to value our stable state more. P.S: I'm aware that I'm talking about this situation as if it was some king of read ordeal, which it definitely was not, but I somehow still managed to stress about it.
P.P.S: I know that I need to not blame myself for having negative emotions, but it is still hard.
On Monday I will have another olympic (probably) and I hope, that I will be able to face it easier.
==August 14th, 2023==
Today was supposed to be the day of the small olympic, that would select a few people for the main olympic. However, I didn't happen.
I had really few information about this event. I thought, that it would start today at 10 am. When the time comes, I didn't get any new information, I asked about this in the group of this olympic. They told me, that there were some technical problems and this event would be postponed for a few hours. As well they promised to inform everyone.
It is 6pm now, and I got no information, they didn't even give us any estimated time.
==August 16th, 2023==
Today was the day of olympic. It took a lot of time and efforts. I did better, then I expected, however my program still does not meet the demands. I will learn the results tomorrow.
My classroom teacher asked us to write a statement about the format of learning we want to get. I was not sure if I will be able to be at DPR at the beginning of the learning year, so I chose a distant learning. However, teacher said, that there were no ensure that the reality will meet our expectations.
==August 25th, 2023==
Today my father and brother went to Crimea. I stayed home because of my studying that will begin in September.
As well today I visited town to help my mother with groceries. 
During the last few days I was doing almost nothing useful, it sure puts a lot of pressure on me, but I'm doing my best to accept this part of myself.
==August 29th, 2023==
Yesterday I got a call from my classroom teacher. The news that I got caught me off the guard.
Do you remember that olympic in which I participated back then, when I was in Crimea, that one, for which I was not prepared and wrote some low-quality code? I did win in that olympic. Now they want me to go to Новгород with my classroom teacher to the interregional olympic. It will last from September 18 to September 21.
### September
==September 13th, 2023==
Today I payed a visit to hospital in Makeevka, I hoped to get a certificate about my wellness. However, I was told, that I needed to go through fluoragraphy and only then I would be able to get this sertificate tommorow in Yasinovka.
I successfully got home with this sertificate.
==September 14th, 2023==
Today I had to Yasinovka to get a sertificate about my wellness. Without this document I would not be able to checked in to the dorm.
The line was surprisingly short. Everything happened quickly. The doctor was not even asking about my health.
I will have to cross all way home on my feet, but I will be earlier than I expected anyway.
==September 14th, 2023==
I had a busy day today (even when the trip has hardly (едва ли) started). 
During the first half of the day I felt weak, as well I spend an awful amount of time dating toilet. I think, that the main reason for that was unease about the journey and my level of knowledge. During that time I managed to only visit the hospital and do my last training for this week.
After training I got better and was able to be present during the first lesson in school. It was my mistake, I barely made it to the bus at 15:40. Of course, there was a race at 16:20, but I was afraid, that I was afraid, that I would not be in time if something unexpected would happen.
I was in time... more than that, I was way too early, more than an hour earlier than it was necessary...
==September 15th, 2023==
Yesterday we had quite an adventure. 
About half of an hour before retreat we were told that our bus broke. This company was not going to give us any replacement.
It was one hell of ordeal to solve this problem in such short amount of time. 
At first we were planing to get to Moscow on the bus, there we had tickets on train to Novgorod from organizer. However, we had to go to Rostov at first, and then to Moscow. The way to Rostov was uncomfortable and we had to wait two hours in the middle of nowhere for our bus to Moscow.
At this moment I am heading to Moscow and this bus is quite comfortable.
==September 15th, 2023==
We arrived to Moscow around 2 pm, our train departure was on 10pm. 
Prices in metro shocked me. A small battle of water cost 90 rubles, just as much as coffee or cola.
Most of the extra time we spend at cafe, I successfully charged my laptop there.
After we left cafe and got to the right station, we decided to pay for luggage security and give Moscow a chance to impress us.
I found it interesting that the first place teachers (both of them were on a diet) lead us to was KFC. As expected, food there was fried and fat, but tasty.
I will send you some photos from Moscow. Mostly, it is just pictures of the town without me. It happened, because we were hurrying and it was hard to take any pictures of myself by myself.
Currently I'm on the upper shelf of the train and I'm heading to Novgorod.
==September 16th, 2023==
We got to Novgorod quicker, than I anticipated, I even didn't have enough time to sleep to the fullest. It was quite a comfortable trip.
On the station we were met by organizers, they hired a bus to take us to the hotel. The name of this hotel is "hotel Russia".
Conditions of live appeared to be quite good. There is toilet, shower , TV, refrigerator, fan (I didn't notice it in the first time), etc. Food here was tasty and satisfying in the term of amount (I will send you the photo of dinner, other meal were richer).
Today we had a free day, so we decided to take a tour across surroundings. We have visited a lot of places, it was really fun, but I think that it would be better to just send you some pictures. For my surprise, I was really able to enjoy this time, even with my pour preparation.
After dinner in hotel we got an excursion, organizers paid for it. To be honest, I found lectures from that expedition to be boring.
On evening we visited Kremlin again, I bought some accessories.

==September 17th, 2023==
I had a truly fascinating experience today.
At the morning I, all by myself, went for groceries and (!), somehow, did not get lost. I will send you some photos that I took on the way there.
At 12:30 we, on the bus, went to Novgorod university. This day was dedicated to setting up our workspaces. The rules of competition are going to be stricter, than I anticipated. The university itself, workspaces and everything else looked amaz/coloring. The only problem, that I encountered was broken headphones on my setup.
Tommorow is going to be the first day of true ordeals.
Last, but the most important topic is my **interactions with people** today.
I met a lot of new people of the same profession as me, it was really interesting to talk with them. Some of them even even claimed, that they would try to spoil the championship by hacking it. 
However, it's all common stuff, the true headliner event of this day is connected with english. Today I met a honest-to-god native speaker and he was not just a sane person, we was a programmer.
Together with him was a girl, student-lengvist, she was responsible for translating information for him. The three of us spend a great time talking about different stuff and (!) I recorded our conversation (!). Now I have more than an hour worth of speech with native speaker recorded! I will send it to you later.
This girl-translator was not a programmer, so it was hard for her to translate some parts, I was helping her.
Bonus (yes, I know, that I claimed the last topic to be the last, but I didn't expect these events to happen and I'm not going to rewrite anything (I won't change the order as well, it would break the logic of events):
During dinner I had another conversation with that english guy, he is living in the same hotel as me (I didn't record this conversation).
Today, as well, we had a night trip across Novgorod, it was really beautiful, I will send you photos from it later. It is a bit cold here at night, so I used jacked, that my mother and granny gave me.
During the night trip we run into the repetition of the concert in the name of our championship.
==September 18th, 2023==
Today I, once again, I talked to Justice (I forgot to tell you his name last time) a lot, we even had a dinner together. Sadly, I recorded almost nothing, because our phones were taken away from us. Today I was helping him a lot, because, for some reason, they did not give him any interpreter, even the person, responsible for looking after him, knows English poorly. By the way, he told, that he wished to learn Russian one day, I offered him my help.
I didn't sleep long enough today. I had a breakfast and left the hotel at 7:30 am.
We went to university. There, together with breaks and technical problems, I was working on module "A" until 5pm. I do think that I made a good enough job with this module, however, I feel really tired.
The organizers lead us to some other events, including the concert, I was talking about yesterday, right after competition.
At first I was really exhausted, and was not able to enjoy anything at that point. However, activities on the way to concert were so interesting and interactive, that I cheered up. They created quite a bit of side-quests on the way there, they had a purpose of introducing us to Novgorod culture.
The concert itself was amazing, they greeted participants in an epic way, there was a great variety of performances, big stage, screens, a bizzare set of camera people, there even was a performance with teslas. 
After performance there was another show, rock symphony (I'm serious).
I finally got home, they even changed the schedule of dinner. It was an extremely intense day.
==September 19th, 2023==
The last days were really exhausting, tommorow is not going to be different.
I didn't have enough time for writing a note, so I did a recording .

I didn't have enough time for writing a note, so I did a recording .
I didn't have enough time today, so I decided to do a recording instead of today's note.
==September 22nd, 2023==
My way back home
**September 22, 15:45** 
At September 21, right after the closing ceremony, we were driven to our train. 
The ceremony itself was way more boring, than the first one. First of all, this event started with 40 minutes delay and we were not given places to sit this time. At the beginning we were shown a couple of good performances, but they were worse than the ones on the first concert. The award ceremony was after that, it lasted more than an hour, I got the fealing that they were doing their best to stretch everything they could. I was not nominated. 
By the way, in the last note I forgot to mention one interesting detail: the winner in my category had the same name and patronymic as me, Michael Andreyevich.
The last time I had a trip in the train, I was in the room with unfamiliar for me people. This time the four of us were in the same room. We had a meal together, after that I edited the photos and felt asleep. I had not enough sleep in the train, but I will catch up on that in the bus.
We got to Moscow about 6:30 am, our bus was going to depart at 11:30 am. However, we were not able to explore Moscow properly, because we had a lot of bags. 
I am currently at the bus, I am going to deploy at Makeevka.
**20:45** 
My bus will arrive to Makeevka on 23th September, about 10 am. I'm spending my time in the bus writing notes, eating, sleeping, reading books, doing flashcards, etc. I don't think, that something else special will happen during this trip.
**7:07 am of September 23th** 
My bus got to Makeevka earlier than I anticipated, I am already at home.

#### Championship
#### Foreword

In this note I will speak my mind about this event and what kind of experience it gave me.

I got the news about this journey at the end of August. I was swaying between taking this chance or turning down this problem. There truly were a lot of wavering, but I did decide to go there and I don't regret that.

The road there was really hard, but, somehow, I found it to be interesting. I got there and was impressed by so many things: by condition of living in the hotel, by kindness and respect that we were given by everyone, by organisation of championship, by people on it and, of course, by Novgorod itself.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 20.08.00.png#center]]
#### Novgorod

I have seen it: the style of this city at the day time, its fascination (обворожение) in night, the glory of monuments, the scale of Kremlin, the greatness of churches, the beauty of nature and, what is the most important, I could have heard it... the silence... the silence of my mind.

Never in my life I was able to quiet my thought that easily and for so long, never I was so present and invested, never I was able to allow myself to be happy with such a slight resistance.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 20.24.33.png#center]]
The concert. It was amazing. There were a lot of fascinating stuff, such as music performances, culture ones, tesla ones, visual effects were amazing. It is really hard for me express my impression about this through words.
#### I met a lot of interesting people.

Before that journey, I had quite a few experience of interacting with other programmers, especially good and ambitious ones. I got to know a lot of experts (teachers of participants), we spend some time together, they treated me with respect.

The most remarkable time I got talking to Justice, he's an English native speaker and quite a good programmer. Neural networks was not his speciality, but he was a good at programming movements for different electro technic (should we use past tense here?).

Sometimes, I was Justice's interpreter. For example, at the times when organisation was failing to give him a way of communication or when the real interpreter's English was weak, or just when it was easier for me, as a programmer, to understand him. I was his interpreter not only for experts, but for people who just wanted to talk with him.

There was one sad situation with Justice. Just as all of us, Justice had to present his work. Of course, someone had to be his interpreter. At that day, there were three people in the room who could translate him: that girl-linguist from the fourth course (Яна (Yana)), her classmate and me. Yana told, that her classmate's English was not as good as hers or mine. That is why she wanted his interpreter to be me (because I'm a programmer) or her.

Sadly, I knew, that I won't be allowed to translate him, because we were both competitors, so I wanted Yana to be the interpreter. However, it appeared that Yana's classmate was responsible for translating Justice that day. She had not done a good job and he got a low score.

Justice took a picture with me and promised to contact me. The people I met thanks to English truly made a difference, not only for my English, but for my inspiration and self-confidence as well.

#### Gratitude

I really do feel grateful for everything that led me to this point. There were so many unpredictable things, which played their part.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 20.25.09.png#center]]
I'm thankful to my teachers who were persistent in asking me to go on this championship.

I'm thankful to myself for accepting their offer, and, as well, for my swaying about this journey. Thanks to that, I got free tickets from my school.

I'm thankful that I didn't go to university, this decision led me not only to this championship, but even to my current self.

I'm grateful to everything that shaped my mentality into the state that allowed me not only to enjoy this ordeals, but to gain all this experience. It was really hard, but even more interesting.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 20.26.11.png#center]]
#### The lesson

At first, I wanted to turn down this adventure, these problems, but I didn't and I'm glad about that. Does it mean that the lesson is about how cool such journeys are? That I should always accept ordeals that have the potential to lead to something interesting?

\- Nope. I don't think that it is about that. There really was no way to predict how it could turn out. Sometimes pain in the ass is just a pain in the ass. What I'm trying to say is that you can not really predict what kind of events will have good or bad influence in the long-term perspective, but what you can say with a great confidence is that those events are the only ones that really happened. In this case, maybe, you should just accept whatever happened, gain experience from it and move on (?).
### October
==October 4th, 2023==
More than 10 days passed since my arrival from Great Novgorod, but, for some reason, It is still hard for me to fulfill even the smallest promises I gave myself.
I'm still did not catch up on my homework, my sleeping time is chaotic, I am not that active on English lessons and I'm not even talking about unexpected problems that I need to solve.
On the way here, I was overfilled with motivation, I had a strong feeling that this adventure made a difference, that I changed. I guess, that it's is not that easy, it will take a lot of time to truly improve myself. I will do my best.
Today I was in Donetsk and got the necessary documents. There was one funny situation: one student greeted me in plural form (здравствуйте).
I successfully got home in one piece.
### November
==November 2nd, 2023==
Today I was in Donetsk. I needed to sign some documents to get a monetary reward for my participation in championship. 
The amount of reward turned out to be a 1000 rubles. I didn't have my own bank account, because of that, it will take more time, but I don't care much about that. 
While I was in the bus, I was reading a book, writing this note, meditating, reinventing my experiences (рефлексировал).
==November 3rd, 2023==
Yesterday I was invited to became a candidate in the competition for the title of the best student. I was trying to get more information on this topic, but I got almost nothing. On the next day I was told that there won't be such a competition, because they forgot to prepare the documents in time.
==November 8th, 2023==
> [!success] Normal one
For a few last days I was worried about one topic. In the first half of October we were told to register in some school to pass exams there. We need to do that, because our last exams were annulled thanks to the change of education system.
I was delaying this business for a long time, and the deadline was drawing nearer. I had to solve this problem until November 15. I had no more time to spare.
Today I almost undertake the ordeal, that I was failing to do for the last 2 years (!). I wanted to go to the bus place in a peaceful way (!!), without running. I had about 20 minutes to spare. I decided to use to do some homework while waiting. Obviously, I had to run again.
I will finish this note tomorrow.

==November 9th, 2023==
> [!success] Normal one
This note is the second part of the last one.
The main source of my fears was the lack of information. My parents and me had no idea about the university and the town I was going to learn in. As fact, we were not even sure, if I should go to university. Depending on these answers I had to choose different exams.
As well, there was a chance that I would have to visit a military office to get some necessary documents or pass tests for the whole school year (!), for all subjects(!!) (one of my classmates got such a condition). On top of that, I had an extremely limited time (until November 15) and I'm not even talking about the preparations for the exams themselves.
Gladly, everything kind of worked out for now. I was told that they had no information at the moment, but they embraced me and said, that there was a possibility that we will be graded according to our previous exams.

==November 10th, 2023==
I spent this night doing homework. That fact and the visit to Donetsk left me without an ability to sleep enough. 
I really need to change my schedule, but today's night was a conscious choice (though, I was planning to spend less time on this task). I finally solved one problem, that was hunting me for the last few weeks (!), however, you should not worry on this account, I still have a lot of ordeals to go through.
Today I had to visit Donetsk to get my student card. 
When I woke up, I was feeling rather weak than sleepy. It was hard for me to finish my breakfast. Obviously, again, as a man, strongly devoted to my traditions, I was running to the bus. 
I successfully got the card, and got home. On the way back I felt better, than in the morning, I even bought myself some food.
==November 11th, 2023==
> [!success] Normal one
Yesterday, I got into a tricky situation. I take 2 buses to get to Donetsk. The first bus got to the station one or two minutes after the second's departure. Because of that I had no choice, but to wait for 40 minutes for another one.
I decided to embrace this situation as it is and gain some profit out of it. 
At first, I wanted to spend this time reading and finishing the food that I bought for myself earlier. However, I changed my mind and decided to ask my mom if she needed something in the town. After I brought some medicine for her, I went to the park. 
Of course, one can not seriously compare parks in the Great Novgorod and this one, however, I still enjoyed this time.
![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 19.00.15.png]] ![[Screenshot 2023-11-17 at 19.00.28.png]]
It is fearsome, how much time we spend in a hurry, we rush (спешить, суетиться) that much, that we tend to forgot, how great it is to stop and enjoy the moment.

==November 15th, 2023==
Today was quite a common day, there is nothing that I could name to be a big success.
For the last few days I'm thinking about moving to a new application for my notes. The new one is clearly better, but there are way too many new features. I can even use HTML and CSS (this ones are powerful tools in the hands of a programer) in that app's notes. However, I'm afraid that I can spend too much time playing with this new app, I'm quite addicted to apps, like this one. I'm planning to limit myself, I will spend only 30 minutes (which is still a lot) setting it up. 
I also think, that I will try to do something like a monthly notes. In those I will write about my plans for the upcoming month and about the way how I spend the old one.
==November 16th, 2023==
I have spend way more time playing with Obsidian (the name of the app, I was talking earlier), then I was planning to. I grow to like it even more. 
I'm currently using Obsidian to write this very note. I have already moved the whole diary here (except images and marks of quality). I was doing it in a smart way, so it did not take much time. However, I did not move from Remnote completely yet.
The first 40% of the day I was doing almost nothing useful, then I spent a lot of time working with Obsidian. However, even with that, I managed to do an ok amount of work today.
==November 17th, 2023==
Today I woke up at 7:30, gradually I'm starting to give a form to my sleep schedule.

For now, I decided to devote one hour per a day to my work with Obsidian. I'm currently trying to decide, how to structure my note and how to make connections between them. I'm having a hard time doing that, because I lack knowledge in this app and tutorials show structures that I'm not satisfied with. I guess, that I will have to accept the fact that I will have to redo the structure a few times before I will get what I need.
==November 19th, 2023==
> [!success] Normal one
>Monthly note
Today is November 19th, a day far beyond the middle of this month. Still, I decided to start a tradition of writing monthly notes today. Of course, this note will lack in quality, because I didn't have any clarity with my plans for this month, I was just doing what seemed to be the most urgent at the moment and, to be honest, there is not much time left to dream about, but it is okey with me.
Here is my plans for the rest of this month:
>1. finish my course work (or at least about 70% of it);
>2. adjust my sleep patterns. I want to fall asleep at 9:30 pm and wake up at 5:30 am;
>3. complete my diary of practice (it is necessary for my technical school);
>4. adjust the time of my trainings (I tend to delay my trainings to the end of the day. I need to have a proper meal after training, because of that, sometimes, I even have to move my english lessons). I want to do my trainings before the lunch;
>5. make my meditation sessions more stable, one at the morning after posture exercises and one right before sleep (I tend to delay the morning one);
>6. renew my study of Crime and Punishment (at least 3 chapters).
>
Probably, the list is not complete, but I don't have time to spend recalling (вспоминая) the rest.
What I will gain from achieving this:
>1. after I catch up to school homework, I will have more time for everything else;
>2. thanks to stable schedule, I will have more energy;
>3. I will feel better about myself, will be able to trust myself more.
>
Main obstacles:
>1. the teacher responsible for course work checks our works rarely, It will be hard to get a feedback (by the way, I'm looking forward to learn the origin of this word);
>2. it is hard for me to start working on something;
>3. I tend to find "urgent" problems before falling asleep or trainings;
>4. I spend too much time playing with Obsidian.

==November 20th, 2023==
I wouldn't call this day successful. I woke up at 8 am (it was conscious decision, because I fall asleep late, but still), did almost no progress nor in my course work nor in diary of practice. I was not feeling energetic today and I will fall asleep late again. I need to be more mindful about my decisions.
Anyway, I have high hopes for tomorrow, I will do my best.
==November 21st, 2023==
Sadly, I was not able to answer my expectations for this day. I guess that the main problem is the way how I start my days. 

My schedule is unstable and it takes some time for me to wake up. Because of that and other factors, I tend to start my day with procrastination. The longer it lasts, the harder it gets to finish my morning routine. Also, I feel that in the days, that I start like this, I lack concentration and energy. I really need to fix that.
==November 22nd, 2023==
A few weeks ago I start using one motivational app for self-improvement. On this app there is such a feature as parties. People from one party share responsibility for missing tasks of each member. Thanks to that, people need to motivate each other. 

I joined one party. People there text in English (they are not native speakers, though). I decided to save some of my messages in my diary.

>1) **Introduction**
>I'm 18. I'm currently studying as a programmer. Other than that, I'm studying in another university online, working out, reading, doing meditation and learning English.
>
>On average, I'm doing well with my self-improvement. However, I'm inconsistent and It is hard for me to combine learning and rest. My mood strongly depends on my productivity. I know, that it is not a good thing, but I am working on it.
>
>The next year is promising to be stressful for me and, probably, I will have to move a few times.
>
>Feel free to message me If I skip my dailies.
>
>2)**A talk about meditation**
>Me: So, you guys, (what about commas here?) meditate too? It is good to hear. 
>
>I have been doing meditation for quite some time, but I'm inconsistent. For the last month I've been doing meditation two times a day, but the time of my morning session is inconsistent. Also, I noticed, that during this month, the quality of my meditation was low. I really need to do something about it.
>
>Other guy: Michael, what are you thinking do get doing about the quality of your meditations? I have also noticed mine being of actual good quality quite rarely.
>
>Me: I think that the main problem is the way, I spend the rest of the day. If I start my morning with information noise, it affects not only my meditation sessions, but the rest of the day as well. When I'm having a "bad day", I'm just trying to get it over with. 
>
>So, I guess, I just need to be more disciplined and conscious throughout a day


<hr>
Today I'm doing ok. I was able to wake up at 7:20 (which is already something) and do my training before the lunch. When it comes to avoiding information noise, I was doing better today. I was able to clean the kitchen and to cook a soup without distracting myself.

I will have to go to Donetsk tomorrow, so I decided to finish my diary of practice and application list. If I manage to do it today, I will be able to save myself from one extra trip to Donetsk.
==November 23rd, 2023==
> [!Success] A normal one
Yesterday I decided to complete my diary of practice and application. I needed to do that in purpose of avoiding another trip to Donetsk. 
>
I did the digital part, but it was late, so I decided to do the handwriting part at the morning (simply put, I prepared the text, that I needed to write in the table by hand).
>
I woke up at 6:30am. In the morning, once again, I was feeling bad. For some reason, after all this time at home, any adventures outside of my country are giving me a lot of stress. Sure,  it would be understandable if the fear of military action was the case, however, I'm sure, that it is not.
>
About 8 am I noticed, that the blanks for diary were printed at two sides of each sheet (I printed them earlier, at November 14, using the new printer that I set up for my mother's work). The blanks were supposed to be one sided, so I could not use them. I decided to print it in Donetsk and fill it there.
>
When I left home, I did not let down my mark of quality, I was running to the bus again. 
>
I successfully finished my business in the trade unit (профсоюз) and was going to use nearby windows sill to fill the practice diary, however, my classroom teacher run into me and invited me to her office. It took me about 40 minutes to write the whole text. I was really glad that my teacher allowed me to do it in her office.
>
After I gave away all the documents, I spend about an hour to do all the shopping for my mother and brother.

Right now I'm still alive and on my way home.

==November 24th, 2023==
My grandmother (Alina, the one, that lives in Crimea) can not walk. Somebody need to take care of her. Right now my father is looking after her. The last time he was at home is a few weeks ago, he was here less than a week. He is really tired, so we decided that I will take his place for a couple of weeks, so he could spend some time at home.

I need to use a but to get to Crimea. Probably, I will leave DPR at the nearest Monday of Tuesday. The bus will depart at about 5 am, so I will have to take a taxi to be in Makeyevka at that time.
==November 25th, 2023==
Today my mother had her birthday party. My friend were also there. We spend that time playing the game, where we needed to draw a picture of the certain topic and other person needed to guess it (we were using our phones, instead of real paper, though). 
Sadly, I did no progress on my course work for the last few days, I need to fix that.
==November 26th, 2023==
17:50
I need to quickly get to Crimea to look after my grandmother. My bus was scheduled at 5:30 am at first, but the time was altered to 4:30 am. The bus driver says, that it should not be a big problem for us to get there. Well, I can say for sure, that it is.

We agreed with one driver, that he would get me to the bus station. He got ill. We were not able to find anyone who would want to drive at that time. It was decided that I will spend a night at my grandfather's place in Makeyevka and take a taxi from there.

I took the bath and gathered my things, we were at the bus stop at 4:40 pm. My mother came with me. It is 5:52 now, I'm grateful, that there is a roof on the bus stop. I'm also grateful for my trip  I'm grateful, that there is a roof on the bus stop. I'm also grateful for my trip to Great Novgorod for that raincoat, that was gifted to me there.
20:04
I got to my grandfather at 18:30 and found a driver a few minutes ago.

Version in telegraph: https://telegra.ph/How-I-got-to-Crimea-11-27
![[Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 20.33.27.png#center]]
#### The reason for this journey

A few month have already passed since my grandmother lost her ability to walk. It happened, because of a few reason, but the main ones were her lack of movements and the fact, that she didn't watch her diet, even when her diabetes was diagnosed.

My sister, brother and I were visiting Alina (the name of my grandmother in Crimea), but most of the time, my father was the one to look after her. He almost doesn't see the rest of the family. I needed to take his place for a couple of weeks. For that I needed to get there on a travel-bus.

##### What worries me

Crossing the map was always a huge source of stress for me. I have never was on such a long journey with strangers (the journey to Great Novgorod was different, there were teachers). I think, that I need to take on such a ordeals to overcome myself (I know, that such a fuss sounds like a joke, but it's not).

#### Troubles with taxi

###### Why I needed a taxi

Everyone was in hurry, so I had only three options (choose the chair):

1. The one, that would drops me in Sevastopol at 11:30 pm;

2. The one, that departs at 5:30 am;

3. The one, that drops me in Yalta (the way to my grandmother's house from Yalta is three times longer, than the one from Sevastopol).

We chose the second one. The travel-bus will take me from the Papyrus.

It takes 10 minutes for me to get to the bus stop, it takes 25 minutes for the bus to get to the bus station, it takes 10 minutes for me to get to the X-place from the bus station and, of course, it takes a bus, that does not go at that time. By the way, I almost forgot one small detail: one can not leave his home until 4 am in our region.

Obviously, I needed to use a taxi. Good thing, that my mother found one person, who agreed to take this role.

#### Quick decisions

On Sunday morning we found out that the departure time was changed to 4:30 am. The travel-bus company didn't care about complains. We were not able to contact the driver for a few hours, when we did, it appeared that he got ill.

There was no mobile network and we could not find anyone, who would want to drive me at that time, in internet. It was decided that I should go to my grandfather's place in Makeyevka and take a morning taxi from there.

It was already quite late. I took a bath, prepared everything for the journey and went to the bus stop. My mother came with me, thanks her for that. There was a heavy rain. I'm grateful, that there was a roof on the bus stop. I'm also grateful for my trip to Novgorod the Great for that raincoat, that was gifted to me there. We were waiting for the bus a bit more ,than I anticipated (from 4:40pm to 6:05 pm).

My grandfather and his wife met me, when I got to Makeyevka. They treated me well while I was in their place. It was sweat.

We were not able to find a taxi, that ensure their appearance at that time, so they asked their neighbour for help. He drove me to the X-place at the morning and refused to take any money. On the way there, he asked me about the situation, I explained it to him. Maybe, that is why he refused to take money? I should not have told him that...

#### The rest of the way

I departed from Makeyevka. When we got to Crimea, we changed the vehicle to another travel-bus. There is (still) a wild storm in Crimea. Everything is in the snow and the wind is extremely strong.

One kind woman from the travel-bus helped me to find schedule of buses from Sevastopol. She also explained me, how to get to the bus station.

I said goodbye to the travel-bus and and with the help of other strangers found the bus that I needed. I was lucky and found a bus, that brought me right to my grandmother's village. If it didn't, I would have to cross 4-6 kilometers on foot from the nearest town.

I got to my grand house at about 4:10 pm. This journey was not the longest, but, for sure, one of the most tiring.
==November 28th, 2023==
Today I spend the first half of the day helping my father to prepare everything for moving to DPR. He showed me how to do injection to my granny, use washing machine, fix water problems and, as well, he instructed me about the food in the house. I helped him to start his car (it is really hard to do this while it is cold outside, we had to spend more than an hour to do that) and prepared a travel-meal.

In the second part of the day, I was taking care of Alina, preparing food, working with the fireplace, washing stuff, doing homework, etc. It is a bit hard for me to combine education with my house duties, but I think, that I will get used to it.
==November 29th, 2023==
For the last few month my father was the one to take care of my ill granny, but he needs a bit of a rest. I moved to my grandmother's house two days before to replace him. Today was the first day that I spend alone talking care of her.

I spend this day mostly doing my house duties, such as washing clothes, preparing food, dealing with fireplace, doing injections to my grandmother, etc. It sure takes a lot of time and I am not able to keep up with my learning schedule. Not only that, but I have a lot to clean up in the house.

I need to do my best to work out some good day plan to find time for all the important tasks. I. guess, that I will start the next day by altering my habits and dailies lists.
==November 30th, 2023==
I decided to divide my monthly notes in two pieces: one for reflexing about the result of the month and another one for the upcoming month.

I successfully completed only one part of my plan, I finished my diary of practice. As well, I partially done another two tasks: renew the learning of Crime and Punishment (I did that, but I was planing to read more), adjust the time of my trainings (I successfully doing my trainings in the right time, but only for the last two days).

The most problematic part is my course work. I made almost no progress. I'm not sure, how much I have left, but starting from tomorrow, I will have to do my school practice homework and learn online on the second block of Synergy university course.

The main reason for my lack of progress is, of course, my lack of discipline and the urgent move to my granny. I think, that I still could have complеted my plans, if I was stronger and more flexible. Anyway, it is what it is. I will try to get better.

### December
==December 1st, 2023==
Today I did better job than yesterday. I finished and send a new part of the course work to the teacher. Of course, I did all my house duties (washing clothes, heating the oven, injections, cooking, etc). As well, today I did a good job cleaning. I need to spend some time on that, because the house was in a quite a bad state, when I got here. If I keep this up in the same rhythm, the house will be in an acceptable state in about a week.

I decided to postpone my monthly note to tomorrow, because I'm short of time and I don't want to do it just to get it over with.
==December 2nd, 2023==
Today I did almost no progress nor in my course work or cleaning, I even had to delay my english lesson (usually I do them almost every day (I'm writing these explanations, because I will send some part of this text to my Habitica community)). Honestly, this time I can't even blame myself for that, this day was full of unexpected problems.

I decided to delay my dinner, because I felt weak and had no appetite. My grandmother wanted to take a bath. Usually wipe her off. However, this time she decided to take a full (полноценную) bath. The bath in her house is quite large and high. My granny weight 1.5 as much as I do, so it took about 45 minutes to get her inside. I knew for sure, that it would be nearly impossible for me to take her out of the bath by myself, so I placed a chair inside, if she would lay down. That is why I placed a chair inside the bath. At first, everything went well, but then, my granny decided to lay down anyway, she was way too persistent.

As time went by I was feeling worse and worse, but I was ignoring it, because I had larger problem to come. Obviously, my granny was not able to get out of the bath. We decided to take a strategy of raising the level of the bath by slipping clothes under her. We straggled more than an hour. By that point, I was no longer able to ignore my well-being, I started to throw up. As well, I had diarrhea. 

At about 16:45 we both were exhausted. My granny decided that we both needed to sleep. She was already on the bunch of clothes, so I had to just cover her with a blanket. I was vomiting for a long time before I was able to fall asleep. At about 11:30 pm we both woke up and it took us about an hour to get her to the bed. After that I felt asleep again. Right now I feel way better.
==December 5th, 2023==
A few weeks ago I signed up for exams, that were necessary for me to get to university. They were not sure about the subjects that I would need to learn or time of examination (it is kind of not examination to university, but I don't want to explain it, because it is quite complicated). They promised to call me after November 15th. They didn't. At November 26th (or about so), I had to urgently move to my granny and switch places with my dad who was taking care of her. (this information was necessary for the context)

Today I got some unexpected news. Tomorrow at 9 am I will have to pass examination at my home town. I'm not prepared for exams, because I was not told what subject I will need to pass and when... and It is more than 650km away... and I need a few days to book tickets... and I can't live my granny alone...

Anyway, I will have to urgently move back after my father gets here. One of my friends told me, that there will be an opportunity to retake exam, if they find my reasons to be valid.
==December 6th, 2023==
Monthly note (the one, that I had to write at December 1st)

My goals:
1. advance with my meditation;
2. be more conscious;
3. finish my course work until December twelve;
4. do my homework for my online studying in university in time;
5. finish this month without any tail (nor in Synergy university or Technical School);
6. do preparations for my Russian exam;
7. clean my granny's house good enough until my dad comes in (I was not given this task, but I already promised myself to do that);
8. do at least 5 Crime and Punishment recordings;
9. add a couple of new exercises to my English lessons;
10. consciously spend a few hour to reflect about different stuff.

What I will gain from it:
1. educational progress;
2. I will free myself from the burden of stress about my unfinished businesses;
3. more self-confidence and trust to myself;
4. happier life.

Main barriers:
1. I have already done some progress in my course work, but I still have to feedback from the teacher, I don't know if my work is correct;
2. short videos;
3. moving home;
4. I'm not sure if I will be allowed to retake my Russian exams.

Today I was going to the local shop to buy some stuff for my grandmother. There were a lot of items. After I got back, she asked about the juice. I lied and said, that there was no juice available. I immediately regretted my words, it is really important to me to be honest. Usually, I'm easily able to tell the truth, even I'm ashamed of it. I value such moments as this one, because it reminds me about the fact, that I have a lot to work on.

In the nearest few days, my father is going to switch places with me. I need to work extra hard to clean the house, do house duties and to catch up on my studying. Of course, I can catch up after my fathers arrival. However, I was planning to build my regime and discipline before that. However, I just don't want to rely on that, I have already promised to myself to build my regime and discipline before that and, to be completely honest, I would hurt my ego too much, if I can't combine my house duties and studying. Of course, I don't see anything bad about taking help from others, but it is a bit different case, I'm sure, that I not doing my best and that I could handle it myself.
==December 8th, 2023==
> [!success] Self-cultivation

Right now I have an awfully lot of things to do. I need to finish my course work, take care of my granny, prepare for my Russian exam that will happen in December 15, do learning practice assignments, learn in an online course in university. The worst part about this is that most of my problems or, probably, all of them, are stemming from my own mistakes. I have postponed a lot of things and now, they are coming after me.

Of course, I know, that I have what I have, that there were reasons for every action that led me to this point. Still, I can't help, but to think, that I want myself to be different. I want myself to be able to handle all of this without wavering and, maybe, even warn all of this beforehand.

For some reason, I don't find myself in panic. Sure, I want to be someone, who can face problems with a strong mind, without wavering, but something is off. Am I relatively calm because I am strong or I just don't care anymore? Am I just loosing my heart, giving up? I don't know, it scares me.

Anyway, I guess, that I need to sacrifice something to do more important stuff. Of course, I can't buy time through taking bad care of my grandmother. My learning practice length until December 21st, my exam is at December 15th. I can give up on making learning practice assignments in time for now, course work and examination are more important.
==December 9th, 2023==
Tomorrow my dad arrives. Most of the day I spend in preparations, I cleaned the house to a bearable state and cook a good amount of food. To be honest, I don't know why I'm doing this extra job even when I have a lot of more important stuff to do. Of course, I can say, that it is a showcase of my love or something like this. Sure, partially, it is true, but the believe that there are other reasons. Am I doing this because I need some kind of praise? Is it that important to me, or, maybe, It is another way of procrastination? I'm not sure.
==December 10th, 2023==
My father arrived at about 10 am. I helped him to move everything. I was not able to do all the cleaning that I was planning to do, but it was enough to surprise him anyway. I fed him, he liked the food. Usually, I'm able to enjoy cooking only when I have free time to not hurry and enjoy the process, but this time, I was able to do that even with given circumstances. I also helped him a few times with other businesses throughout the day. 

Sadly, I have to recognise, that today I did almost nothing useful, other than helping my father. I had a lot of time, but I was not able to start working on anything.

Today was planed a lesson with my English teacher. At the moment, she was helping me to prepare for my Russian exam. I was not able to contact her, she was not online. I am really worried, because there is a military action near our country, something serious could have happened.
==December 11th, 2023==
Today was able to combine helping my father with my solving my own problems. I can't say, that I did not waste any time, but, still, it was quite a productive day. I finally finished the practical part of my course work. A lot of paper work is ahead, but I hope, that I will be able to finish it tomorrow or the day after (it will be hard to achieve, but I'll do my best).

I found out, why I was not able to contact my English teacher nor yesterday or today. She has problems with electricity. It seems that for a while I will not be able to contact her. Because of that, the preparation for the exam is promising to be more challenging.
==December 12th, 2023==
Tomorrow I will have a move to another place, I need to leave to granny because of the exam, that will happen at December 15th. I had a great plans for today. First of all, I needed to pack my things and finish my course work. A large part of the day I was working on that. However, I was  also doing some other stuff throughout the day. I carried one ton of coal to house and helped my father to install a washer. I also had a webinar at online university course today.

I am departing tomorrow early at the morning. I decided to finish my course work today. To be honest, there is no specific reason, why I have to finish it exactly today. However, the teacher, that is responsible for course work, did not state a deadline and I can say for sure, is that I have missed all the recommended terms. At any moment she can wrap things up, so I can not prepare for the upcoming exam peacefully. 

I made a decision to not sleep this night and finish my course work. I will be able to catch up on my sleep in the bus. Maybe, this is not a good decision, but, probably, this one is the best from the given ones.
==December 13th, 2023==
I wasn't sleeping the whole night in hopes to finish my course work. However, I overstimated my abilities. At this point I have about 60% of the paperwork done. I will also need to make presentation and report for my work. I guess, that I will try to finish it before the exam anyway.

I got to my bus at 6:30 am (it was delayed to this time). Most of the way I was sleeping. I arrived at 4:10 pm to Makeevka, however, the bus to my country departed at 4:55 pm. It was cold outside, so I was not able to prepare for my literature exam.

I will arrive at home at about 5:45 pm. I can't afford the luxury of long rest right now, so I will have a lesson with my teacher to prepare for the exam at 7 pm.
==December 14th, 2023==
Today I was told that my exam was postponed to February 7th. It happened because too many of students were ill. I feel conflicted about this situation. I am glad, that I will have more time for preparation, however, It also means, that I will have to spend a lot of time on preparation for this exam and I will not be able to get over with this exam in the nearest time.

Sadly, today, even when I have way less responsibilities than before, I started to procrastinate a lot. Of course, the exam was postponed, but I still need to deal with my course work, university course learning and learning practice in my technical school.
==December 15th, 2023==
> [!success] Self-cultivation

Today I woke up at 7:20 am. There was no internet until 9:00. I used this time to do my morning routine and the training, that I was supposed to do before dinner. I got free at 9:20 and had the second breakfast (I am currently trying to get some muscle mass and I lost a couple of kilos during that trip to my granny, so it is important for me to eat a lot). I still haven't complete my course work and I was planning to do that today. However, I was wasting time until 11 am, until electricity was turned off.

So, here I'm. It is my third day at home and I am still procrastinating. It happens every time, every time something big happens in my life, it takes me a lot of time to adapt. I need to become more flexible. 

> As the four seasons between heaven and earth flow in an endless cycle, so too, must man work his way, through his own cycles of seasons continuous. If you are able to to endure a long hard winter, a fresh new spring is sure to follow, invigorating with  strength renewed.

It is a quote from one piece of art. For some reasons it inspires me. We all have our weak and strong sides. Sometimes we can be in a great state, have a strong mind, solve all our problems and be happy to do that. However, sometimes, we can despise ourself, the more we regret, the lower we fall. We can never move in one direction, sometimes we rise, sometimes we fall. The reasons behind our decisions and actions are complicated, we fall in the same states again and again. It is normal. What we should do is to be conscious, learn our mistakes and try to be better so the next time we fall not as low and rise even higher. 
==December 16th, 2023==
Yesterday at 11 am electricity was turned off. I have my course work, that I had to complete a long time ago, as well, I have to do about 15 practical assignments for my learning practice to do until the 21st of December. I could not do any of these assignments without internet, further more, my laptop has run out of battery.

At about 10 am of December 16th (in a day after electricity was turned off) I decided to pay a visit to my grandfather. I hoped to do my course work at his place, because I didn't have any time to wait. I had to go at his place without warning, because I was not able to phone him, there was no mobile network.

!!
Let's put all the worldly (мирские) questions aside, today is the historical day. People from Habitica won't understand, but for the last 2 years I was not able to undertake one ordeal, no matter how hard I was trying. It even became some kind of a meme for me.

On December 16th of 2023, 11:30 am at Moscow time I was on the bus stop, the bus was arriving 11:40 am at Moscow time. I was at the bus stop ON TIME and I did NOT even had to run. No wonder there was snow outside. For the last two years I was running to the bus stop, every time I was getting there at the very last second, sometimes I was even missing it. Maybe that was the compensation for all these troubles, maybe all my life was leading to this point.
!!

Back to the land. I got to my grandfather's place (Makeyevka), but there was no electricity in that part of the town as well. My grandfather and his wife were happy to see me, we didn't see each other for a while, so I spend some time there.

My plan B was to go to the place of my mother's sister in the other end of Makeyevka (I don't know, how this kind of relationship is called. For convenience, I will call her Alena. The way to her has proven to be troublesome (mainly because I was going to her place for the first time and I am bad when it comes to directions). 

I was at Alena's place until evening, she was nice to me. Alena is living together with her mom and the apartment is small. Further more, she was tired after her work week, so I decided not to do her any more troubles and leave. However, I was not planning to give up.

I charged my devices in Alena's place beforehand and went back to my grandfather's place (they are quite happy to take me as a guest, so it is not a problem). Sure, there was no electricity, but there was mobile network. I decided to spend that night working on my course work there.
==December 17th, 2023==
There was no electricity in my grandfather's place in Makeyevka (his name is Pasha), however, mobile network was available. I stayed up at night to finish my course work as soon as possible. I managed to do that, but I still needed to do the report and the presentation for my course work. I was not able to do that because my laptop was running out of charge.

I was planning to go to another place to charge my devices, but Pasha offered me his help. He and his wife contacted with a few neighbours who had electricity generators. It didn't work out, but one of my grandfather's friends had a flat with electricity. I gave him my devices. All this running around took a lot of time, but at about 2 pm I got my laptop back.

I finished my report and presentation at about 4 pm, but I was not able to find mobile network to upload my work until 4:30 pm. Pasha wanted me to stay another night there, but I needed to go home. I got there at about 6 pm.
==December 18th, 2023==
I hoped to get electricity fixed until lunch. Of course, it didn't happen and there was no mobile network in my home. I was anticipating this result and wanted to go to my grandmother (not the one I was taking care of. The one that I'm going to. Her name is Nina). There was electricity and internet there. However, it is (still) hard to get there (to Nina) and my mother wanted me to congratulate one girl in the costume of cent Nikolay (the christian version of Canta Claus) tomorrow (there was no point in going to my granny for a couple of hours). 

During the day time I went to my friend. He had an electricity generator (yes, I decided to use all my connections), but there was no internet.

My mother decided that we should would congratulate that girl tonight. We did that, I had no particular text or scenario, but this child was excited and pleased. It is fun to do such things, because kids are so emotional, they need so little to be happy (be like kids).

At night I was told that the electricity at Nina's (my granny) place was turned off. I decided to go to my sister's work (Yasinovataya) tomorrow. 
==December 19th, 2023==
> [!Success] Self-cultivation

Today I got to my sister work place, there was electricity, but no internet. I hoped to catch some mobile internet. I succeed to do that outside of the building for a few minutes, but mostly all my attempts were vain. 

My sister told that yesterday there had been internet, so I was waiting there until the end of my sister's work day. She gave me a ride to my home.  During that time I was writing English notes, reading books and meditating.

I spend quite a big part of my day reading book about meditation and doing the meditation itself. I liked it a lot. It happened many times to me, I spend some time with more consciousness than usually, enjoy it a lot and then... go back to information noice and other stuff, that makes me feel bad. This time I will try not to repeat the same mistake.

I hope that these experiences will help me to value common opportunities more.

I decided to make a new rule for myself: I will do three conscious breaths before each unlock of my phone.

I got home and found out that Nina (my granny) got electricity and internet turned on at her place today. They were not able to contact me. I just forgot to check this option, I could literally get there without any transport. Nina lives 5 or 6 kilometers away from my sister's work place.

I know that it is a great training for some of my values, I know that I should accept things as they are. However, sometimes, it is just too hard for me to embrace my decisions and not to regret about them.

All this running around made me realise, how much I need the help of other people. Of course, I had no doubts about that, but this situation made me value my connections even more. Because of these problems, I met and spend a lot of time with important people, I would never find time for that under different circumstances. I guess, one can never know, where his life is leading him.
==December 20th, 2023==
Today I went to my grandmother(Nina). One friend of my mother gave me a ride near my granny. I was not able to contact with her at the morning. When I came, there was no electricity, mobile network was not available as well. 

My granny decided that we could not just wait for electricity to appear, so we were running from place to place. It took us a lot of time, but we found a spot in the EC meeting office, where we were allowed to use electricity and there was mobile network. However, right after that, we got a phone call from my granny's husband. Electricity and internet appeared in their place. 

We got home around 3:30 pm. I was trying to work at night, but got tired because of all the adventures and fall asleep around 11:30pm.

It seems that there will be electricity and internet for about 8 to 12 hours per a day. I think I will stay with my granny for a while.
==December 21st, 2023==
Today light was turned off after 11 am. During the time without internet I wrote some notes, rested and did my training.

I wanted to go to theEC meeting office again, but my granny (Nina) and her husband did not let me go alone, because they were worried. I already knew the way so there was no need for that, but my granny decided to accompany me for a few kilometers to that place. 

In the middle of the way we got a phone call. Electricity appeared. I went back home and was doing my homework for the rest of the day. 
==December 22nd, 2023==
I spend this whole day doing my homework for the learning practice. Also online lectures in my technical school have started today. Surely, teachers are not doing full time lessons, but they are still generous with the amount of homework. 

Today I was able to finally contact with my English teacher (LD). I was not able to do that for the last 7 days and was worried. I didn't know the exact place where she is living and was moving from place to place, so I was not able check personally if she was alright. As well, obviously, we were not able to do our lessons. It is quite bad for my preparation for the exam. We will try to make a Russian class tomorrow using mobile network.
==December 23rd, 2023==
> [!Success] Self-cultivation

Today I spend a whole day doing my learning practice assignments, writing summaries for my homework,  taking part in Synergy classes and, for the first time in this long week, in my English/Russian ones.

Today my brother came here as well. There was a barbecue. The electricity and internet finally appeared in my village, I'm going home tomorrow.

My granny, her husband, my grandfather and all other people who took me as a guest were kind to me all this time. They were giving me a good treatment with food, space, other comforts and, of course, a lot of care. Sometimes it seemed as if they cared more than I did. There were no self-interest in their actions, I was not even given an opportunity to do any house duties. They love me sincerely, without any specific reason, unconditionally. I knew this all along, but my perception of this was different. I know that it is silly, but It took me so long to truly feel that, to value it. 

There are many people in this world who love me... need me... appreciate me... believe in me... It makes me happy. 
==December 24th, 2023==
One friend of my mother gave me and my brother a ride to our village. It saved us a lot of time.

My mother had some guests today, I helped with cleaning. At about 7 pm I had a lesson with my teacher (LD). To be honest, other than that, I did almost nothing useful today.
==December 25th, 2023==
Yesterday at night I finally got a grade for my course work (I was waiting for it to be checked for a long time). After I have done some small corrections I got 5 point (it is the highest grade), but I will still need to print my work and bring it to my school. I will do it tomorrow and it will take more than three hours to get there and back.

The teacher also checked all the learning practice assignments, but at that moment I didn't manage to do them all. I asked the teacher about that, she told that I could do some assignments until 11 am of the next day. 

For some reason I decided that It would be a good idea to sleep that night. I was sleeping for about 6 hours, but still did not manage to do all the tasks until 11 am. At about 12 am the internet connection disappeared. Right now I have 16 assignments done out of 18, however the teacher checked only 15 out of them. It is up for the teacher to give me either 4 or 5 points. I guess, that I will complete the rest of the work anyway.

The internet connection appeared at about 4:30 pm.
==December 26th, 2023==
Yesterday one teacher (the one who is responsible for the course work and the learning practice) told, that she would give us grades today at 11:30 am during our class. I had not done some assignments. I decided to sleep that night anyway. I was planning to sleep for 4.5 hours, but ended up with 6.

I have done every assignment, but the last one from the learning practice. The teacher was late and told that she would not check tasks for learning practice today because she didn't have time for that.  

She didn't know that I sent her a few more assignments that morning, but gave me the perfect score anyway. Of course, it is really frustrating, because I could save a lot of energy and time, but it is a good training for my mind. There is no reason for me to blame myself, at that moment, with the information and mindset that I had, it was a good decision, the only decision, that I could made. 

I wonder if I should do the last practice work for my learning practice. I guess, that I will do it anyway, just in case.

I was in Donetsk today. I brought my course work to my technical school and did some shopping for my mother. I got home late, at about 6 pm, I even was late on my Synergy online lesson. It happened because I left house only after the end of my online classes and I was waiting a lot for the bus on the way home.

> [!note] Gratitude

I need to give myself more credit, go easier and be more grateful. I have heard this idea from different sources, including my teacher, LD. Obviously, I totally agree, but I was always good at finding reasons not to do this. From now on, I will do this kind of notes at least once a month. 

1) Travelling is always a hard ordeal for me. For the last few weeks I was doing it a lot and I was doing it with less stress and more confidence.
2) I did a good job at taking care of my grandmother and the house.
3) I helped my father quite a bit with this shift change.
4) I think, that I was able to handle stressful situations well.
5) The week without electricity and internet was quite a challenge, but I did my best to not waste that time.
6) I was able to extract a lot of lessons out of that week.
7) Even with all this commotion I didn't miss a single physical training (though, I had to delay some of them because of the trips)
8) I don't skip my English lessons (of course, the week without the electricity and internet became an exception. However, I do count our missing hours and I am planning to catch up on them).
9) I got better at cooking and cleaning while taking care of my granny.
10) I write daily notes almost without blanks.
11) I renewed my reading of Crime and Punishment.
12) The habit of doing morning posture exercises has chances to survive (I complete it in 7 days out of 10). It is not a good result, but it is better than nothing).

I decided to do a challenge for the people from Habitica and for LD. (It is complicated to explain, but you can create challenges for the party in that app).

**Challenge**:
Give yourself more credit, show your love and gratitude for this wonderful person! ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶

**What you should do:**
Create a list of things, that you should thank yourself for. Write down all the things that you have done well, list everything, that you should be proud about, all the moments, when you went an extra mile. 

Of course, don't write anything, that you don't feel comfortable sharing, but I still recommend you to create a full list for yourself.

**How to win?**

Today I got another few final grades. I have solved almost all of my problems. At this point I only need to close one more subject, do one homework and a project for Synergy university and prepare for the Russian exam that will happen in the beginning of February.

I can not say, that I did a lot today, but this day brought me some good news. 



==December 29th, 2023==
Today I got my final grades for every subject. Right now I have almost no duties and learning assignments comparing to the situation on the beginning of this month. I did quite well. 

Even if I have a lot of free time right now, I still should not weaken my grip. This day was not productive because I spend too much time procrastinating. I was not even resting. It happened not only because I was blaming myself, but as well because I was not allowing myself to do the fun stuff, I though that I did not earn it. All I was doing for the whole day is watching videos that I was not even interested in (+ English lesson, training and some program setups).

I need to be more conscious with my choices. In the nearest few days I will came up with some new set of rules for myself and a plan for the next year.


==December 30th, 2023==
It is another type of note that I will try to do on a regular basis. I will try to find some moments, that are inspiring me. Not only it will help me not to forget about them, but as well to understand myself better.

My sources of inspiration:
1) I have been learning English for about 4 years now. Sometimes it seemed as if I was not making any progress. I knew that my level of English was not bad at all, but I often lacked confidence. In Novgorod the Great I met a native speaker and many students from linguistic universities. I had a lot of fun talking to these people. It really inspired me and gave me a lot of confidence in many things that I'm doing, especially in my English skills;
2) The championship in Novgorod was really hard, but I did quite well. Even with my pathetic level of knowledge at that topic I did not give up, I was able to learn many things in the process. It made me realise that I'm capable of doing so much more, that I though was possible;
3) Novgorod the Great is a really beautiful place, even with all the stress I was able to enjoy this trip. I believe that I was able to achieve the whole new level of meditation and understanding of things. Of course, I was able to do the same before and after Novgorod, but I was never able to do be in this kind of mindset for such a long time. I will work in this direction for sure;
4) During the week without electricity and internet I had to visit many people to do my homework. They were really kind to me and were able to love me unconditionally. It made me happy and reminded me, how much I love them. That week and those people opened a whole new level of understanding of importance of connections with people for me (I used way too much "of's" here).
5) Just the common stuff. Sometimes I have good days, days in which I manage to do a good job and find time for conscious leisure and rest. These days really make me feel refreshed. 
Of course, it is not a full list, but I will do this kind of notes every now and then.
==December 31st, 2023==
I spend quite a big part of this day playing with my friends, sleeping and spending time with my family.

To do some conclusions for the last year I need to run through my notes and understand what I was doing and thinking about during this period of time. It will take a lot of time, so I will not be able to do today. 

To get better in the upcoming year I need to understand myself better. Tomorrow I will try to find and list strong sides of my personality, that can help me to advance.

# 2024
### January
==January 1st, 2024==
Recently I started learning about one topic, about ego. Usually we are told, that it is a bad thing. However, is it really possible for one to improve oneself without ego? 

Let's say that you want to win a school championship. For that you need to believe in yourself, believe, that you worth that. You also need to be ready to overstep a lot of people with the same ambitions. Isn't it arrogant to believe that you are better than all these people, to put your ambitions above others?

SOoou, as it seems to me, I have more accomplishments that an average person of my age, but I am not satisfied with myself, I think that I can and have to be much better. Isn't that greedy? Should I find a way to improve and rase to my standards or I should lower them (standards) and settle with what I'm now?

P.S: I know, that the right answer is to move forward and love myself for all my wins and loses at the same time, but it's kind of hard.
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, to do either of those things I need to change and to change I need to use the strong sides of my personality. In this note I will try to find them.

My trump cards (and how to improve them):
1) My values are going along with self-improvement.
- ability to accept everything as it is - sometimes I'm able to act according to this philosophy and it feels awesome, but for that I need to be more conscious with my actions and thoughts. Meditation is a great training for that.
- being open to a new experience - It is hard to train this, but I, once again, need to be more conscious so I don't miss those opportunities to widen my worldview.
- being honest - when it comes to self-improvement, the most important part is to be honest to yourself, keep your promises to yourself. That is the tricky part for me, It is easy for me to keep my promises to other people, but I constantly let myself down. I have read an article, that told, that your believe in yourself strongly depends on the fact of how often you lie to yourself. In other words, to trust and be confident in yourself, you need to keep your words to yourself.
- being mentally strong. It does sound silly, but this idea really inspires me.
2) It is easier for me to do things for other people. Is it because I'm kind? Or I care too much about others opinion? Or I need people's gratitude to feel good about myself? Or, maybe, I just was raised in this way? Anyway, I can abuse it in some way.
3) I have a lot of ambitions. Of course, it does not sound like a big advantage, but I met an awful lot of people of my age, who did not care about their future.
4) I'm flexible (I don't mean easily adaptive, of course, it is always takes me a lot of time to get used to new rules). What I mean is my ability and willingness to embrace new information and to alter my perception about the world and myself.
5) My achievements inspire me a lot. In the moments when I do well with something, it makes me want to keep going. The better I do, the more inspiration I get (though, maybe, it works like this for everyone ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

Maybe I have forgotten something, but I already want to go to bed.

==January 3rd, 2024==
For the last few days I was not awfully productive. It happened for many reasons, a big one of them is because I started watching a new anime (I'm not recording it in English). It was always hard for me to do small amount of things per a time. When it comes to entertainment contents I either consume nothing or an awful amount. I put some limitation rules for myself, let's see if they work.

I was delaying my year plans for a few days already. I will do my best to write about it tomorrow.
==January 4nd, 2024==
In this note I will try to sum up the results of this last year. I will use my old daily notes to do that.

First thing that I noticed is the inconsistency of my notes, in some months I was writing less than 1 note per a week. This aspect was improved greatly. The quality and length of notes has improved as well. I started writing more about my feelings and plans, make up some conclusions and takeaways from my experienсes. I consider this to be a really important improvement.

Let's talk about the way how I started each of those years. I totally can not name my start of this year to be successful, but it is way better than the start of the previous one. I have done more work. Each of the notes from the last year up to January 25th is full of regrets. I became not only more productive, but, more importantly, more positive.

In January of previous year I decided to meditate on a stable basis and progress in that. I still did not achieve the good results in this direction, especially when it comes to quality. This information is something between "really funny" and "depressing" to me. Obviously, I'm exaggerating my disappointment, but it is still not a good result. I need to work in that direction.

I read many notes from this year and was surprised, I was always writing about things that went wrong and almost never about WHY and HOW to change/avoid it (maybe, I was thinking about it, but was not expressing my thoughts in text form). I started to dig deeper only recently. I will do my best to keep moving in that direction.

Some of interesting things, that I have experienced during this year:
- my attempt to work on the project with Mikhail Georgievich and other people. We were trying to create a program for decision analysis. I made a program that used Saaty's method. However we were not able to get a grant for developing this project because of slow work with documentation from the side of university.
- Some adventures that I had to go through because I lost my phone.
- My trip to Novgorod the Great.
- The time that I spend taking care of my granny.
- The week without electricity and internet.

I'm grateful to this note, because of it I found out that I had made some progress not only with my studying, but also with my mindset.

Daily portion of gratitude: 
- I'm grateful to myself for the fact that I renewed my habit of reading books ("Crime and Punishment" doesn't count, because it is not stable),
- for my work on my new training system, that will be better for my health,
- for the fact, that I finally started my preparation for the math exam,
- for being a bit more conscious,
- for going to bed earlier, than usually.

==January 5th, 2024==
Almost all my life I had some portion of sport in my life. I was playing football, cycling, participating in some school sport activities, doing some stupid sport challenges, etc. However, I gain consistency with my individual trainings only two years ago. 

After these two years I got a normal level of physical shape and a good amount of knowledge about training. My training sessions are consistent and I'm trying to give it all up in each set. Though, Iately, It seems to me that I make no progress. I am not gaining weight, my strength is not increasing and it is hard to track the grow of my muscles. 

I believe that there are three main factors:
- I don't eat enough. Recently I started tracking my calories and it is hard for me to hit my daily norm.
- I can not choose the direction in which I want to move, I'm trying to gain muscle size, calisthenics strength (ability to move your body in space (pull ups, dips, etc)), weighted calisthenics strength, flexibility, endurance and learn a few hard technical exercises.
- I was told, that I should not lift heavy weights because of my spine problems, it is bad for my health. Because of this limitation it is hard to work on my muscle size, especially when it comes to legs.

I decided to make up my mind and shift my focus on something more narrow. I decided to work to achieve the calisthenics type of strength and flexibility. It will not only be beneficial for my health, but will also allow me to track my progress easily. I will be able to do that thanks to different progressions in hard exercises. 

A bit of gratitude: I think that I can safely say now that I'm doing my trainings before the lunch, just as I planned, it is also good that I had a lesson with LD today and that I continue to analyse my experiences in different arias.
==January 6th, 2024==
This day was not successful. I don't know how to balance between work and leisure time. It seems to me that once I start doing some kind of entertainment, It is hard for me to get out of it. Once I start, I keep making weak decisions. It is as if I can either be really productive or do nothing useful at all (of course, I am being a bit too dramatic here, I do something, but that is not enough).

For the last few days I was reading one book about training with my bodyweight. It inspires me a lot. Though I don't have trainings neither today or tomorrow, so I am trying not to overdo it and let my body rest a bit.

Tomorrow I will write my plans for this year.

Some gratitude:
- I inspired LD (my English teacher) to work on herself more, physically and mentally, it is good.
- I am grateful to myself, because I keep reading books;
- I'm consistent with my trainings, it is good. I also don't forget about the rest for my body, it is really important.

==January 7th, 2024==
My plans for this year. 
___
This year is going to be quite troublesome and unpredictable for me. I will graduate from my technical school this year and will have to deal with military service. Most likely, I will go to some university to delay my military service (I want to win some time, because there is a war in our country right now).

At this point, I'm not sure, where I should go, I didn't even choose the town. I can learn in the same place where I live right now, but universities here are not considered to be good. Learning at my grandma's place is an another option, but I will have to spend at very least 4 hours to get from home to university and back. There are 2 more options.

Here are some of my plans about studying for this year:
1) To finish reading Crime and Punishment until February 7th.
2) To pass successfully my exam on February 7th.
3) I want to save my habit of reading everyday.
4) To start working on my diploma project before the end of January.
5) To finish my diploma and all the other stuff. This time I will aim to do all of my learning work ON time (not IN time).
6) To find a company for my industrial practice, successfully finish working there with a new experience and whatnot.
7) To finish my studying in my technical school.
8) To finish my online course in Synergy university.
9) To pass successfully my math, Russian and computer science exams.
10) All the other stuff is quite unpredictable, so I will try to concentrate on something, that I have more control over. 

Of course, the most control I have over my own mind (or, at least, I should). I think that this is actually going to be my main priority. I do so many weak decision and it is really hard to feel good about myself sometimes. I want not only to become more disciplined, conscious, but also to love myself more, be able to understand myself, my feelings, the reasons of my actions and emotions.

Also I want to put more emphasis on my trainings. I'm not sure how much progress I have made in the last year, because I was shifting my priorities all the time. It is not good. I will try to do better job this time to understand my progress and my body better. Here are some of my goals:
1) 10 (at very least 5) one arm push ups with a good form on each arm. Right now I can do 1-2 reps with bearable form.
2) 3 (at least 1) one armed pull ups on each arm. 
3) 50 pistol squats on each leg. Right now I can do about 25 reps on each leg
4) 5 dragon pistol squats on each leg. At the moment I can do 0-2 reps.
5) 20 (at least 10) handstand push ups without a wall. Right now I can do 7 reps with a wall.
6) work on my core muscles and grip strength. 

Those training goals can look a bit ambitious, but I think, that I will be able to achieve them.

**Gratitude time**: 
- this note in not bad, it can be quite useful in the future,
- good work with reading,
- for the last few days I finally use my obsidian setup. All those notes can be useful not only in the future, but it also helps to understand information better.

==January 8th, 2024==
Today was not a greatly productive day, but this time I have an excuse. The real winter finally started in our country and I had to spend a lot of time and efforts to clean off the snow out of our house territory. I had to do it twice, because the snow was not stopping. It seems, that I also caught a cold.

Today I got the information about my next learning semester. It will start at January 12th.

Right now I have to choose between trying to do some progress with the Synergy project or going to sleep. I guess, that I need to build some kind of sleeping pattern, that is more important right now.

Gratitude punch:
1) I keep reading books, it's good;
2) I think that the quality of my meditations has improved a bit;
3) I continue my preparation for the exam on February 7th;
4) I train according to my new training program, it is going good for now.

==January 9th, 2024==
I continue to train according to my new program. Though I have to change it every once in a while. It happens because I use a few sources of information to build my training program and I'm yet to finish reading one book, that I use as a main source of information (maybe, I should have changed my workouts after finishing my system, but I was way to excited to wait).

Today I got some information about the upcoming call in Habitica, I'm looking forward to it.

Gratitude splash:
1) I don't betray my new habits and keep taking care of them daily.
2) I currently working on the quality of my reps during training. I slow down to learn to feel the work on my muscles and avoid traumas. All this is lowering the amount of reps and it hurts my ego so I want to praise myself for doing it.
3) I manage to complete my list of calories each day for a few days in a row.

==January 10th, 2024==
For the last few days my sleeping schedule was a mess. I fall asleep at about 2 am and wake up at about 11 or 12 am. Not only it takes me more time to sleep, but it also violates my level of energy. 

I also did no progress in my learning project. I don't have to do it. It gives me only 5 points out of a 100, but I want to do it anyway. I think that is will help me to understand the topic better. Not to mention, I already promised myself to do it, so it will hurt my ego to give up on this.

Today I finally did some progress on the project, I hope to finish it tomorrow. Though, I had to give up on reading and math today. Of course, I could do a bit of it today, but in this case I would have to fall asleep at about 11:45 pm, which is not good enough.

A gratitude dive:
1) I'm grateful to myself for putting my sleep above other things.
2) Being able not to be angry with myself for missing my dailies is also a good thing.
3) I do routines to fix my scoliosis every day (though, I do it in different time because of my inconsistent sleep).

==January 11th, 2024==
Today I was able to wake up way earlier than I usually do. I did all my dailies and had a lesson with my English teacher (actually I have one almost every day, but usually don't write about it). Though, I was not able to finish the project, that I was talking about, because I spend quite some time playing with friends. 

Tomorrow my online classes are starting. It will be hard to combine my new habits and preparation for exams together with doing homework for my school, but I'll do my best.

A gesture of gratitude:
- I am grateful to myself for being able to spare some time to spend with my friends.
- I did a good job reading today. I flew into the process and was reading for 70 minutes, which is more than usual.
- I will fall asleep at relatively early time.

==January 12th, 2024==
It snowed today. I was finishing a cleaning process at the moment when my mother got home from work. 







==January 13th, 2024==
Today our Habitica party had a call. We got to talk to each other, that, in my opinion, will help us to be more motivated not to let each other down. Not only that, I finally got to talk to like minded people in English and it was really interesting. I'm learning this language for about 4 years now and I like English a lot. It can sound silly, but it feels kind of lonely not to be able to talk to almost anyone on it. 

I decided that my main goal for this week is to build my sleeping schedule. Today I'm going to bed only 1.5 hours later, that I had to. Not matter how funny it sound, but it is already some kind of a progress.

P.S: yes, I'm not talking about everything else today, because there is almost nothing good to talk about, I wasted the whole day.

GRrrratitude time:
- I keep doing exercises for my scoliosis every day;
- I am falling asleep today (not tomorrow);
- I spare some time to play with my friends.

==January 14th, 2024==
This day was a bit more productive. I was reading Crime and Punishment, having my English lesson, did some preparation for my math exam. Though I did not manage to fall asleep on time. 

Some praise:
- I did a good job reading Crime and Punishment and breaking down it's chapters;
- I manage to eat full set of calories for the last few days;
- I play with my dog every day, even if it is really cold outside.

==January 15th, 2024==
Today was the second day of a new semester of my college learning. Today we had 5 lessons planed, but only 3 teachers decided to do their classes. I had a hard time listening to teacher during the first lesson, because of my sleeping schedule. The English lesson today was interesting, we were talking a lot about computer science stuff and also we assured the teacher to watch one anime.

The part with gratitude to myself:
- I think, that I will be able to fall asleep earlier today.
- I helped my parents by cleaning snow on our territory.
- I wasted less time than yesterday (if we will not count a few hour of extra sleep).

==January 16, 2024==
Today I finally woke up relatively early (3 hours earlier than usual, but 2 hours later than according to my plan). I feel like this day was more successful, than the previous ones.

After lessons in my college I had a workout and spent more time with my dog than usual. I made some progress reading the book, that I need to finish for my exam, and did some homework.

 Though I was not able to send it to teachers, because the electricity was turned off in the evening. I hope that we will get it back soon. On the bright side, thanks to the absence of electricity, today I will finally fall asleep on time.

Today I also got a phone call about the exams. During this week I will need to solve some problems with my documents.

Time to praise myself:
1) I'm happy, that I am able to be positive even when talking about hardships.
2) I continue to find creative ways to challenge myself during workouts.
3) I will finally fall asleep on time. 

==January 17th, 2024== This note was written on January 20th

I still had no electricity. Also I got a phone call about my exams yesterday, I had to appear at one place to sign some documents. I also had some online lectures today. Obviously I would not be able to be present on them because I had no electricity. I came up with this plan: go to the place where I needed to sign documents and use mobile network to participate on the main online class there (there is no mobile network in my village).

This time I got to the bus stop without running!!! Though I was originally planning to take a previous bus... Anyway, it's still counts! 

There were some unexpected events, so I had to participate in that online class while being on the street. That teacher allowed not to write a summary of a lecture to students who were answering during the online class (I must have made a few grammar mistakes here so feel free to correct me). However, the teacher did not allow me to answer this time, because I already had got a few grades this way. I was trying to persist. The teacher asked me about my reasons. I said, that I would have to write a lecture if I don't get a grade. She laughed and said that it would not kill me to write a lecture once in a while.

After that I signed those exam documents. I had to choose one exam variation out of two. I have chosen the harder variation, because it will give me more options for learning in the future. I got to choose the subjects, that I wanted to be examined with. The main subjects are math, Russian and computer science, I need them to get to a university. Also, just for the fun of it, I choose the written and oral English exams, I think, that I have some good chance to pass them successfully. 

After I got home I helped my father with one business. We still had no electricity, so he decided to use the energy generator, that was bought many years before, but was not used. Though it was placed far from our home, so we had to use a car. The generator weighted more than 50 kg, so it was quite hard to deliver it, we spend more than an hour to do that. Obviously, as soon as we brought the generator (how else could this be), the electricity from government was turned on.

I don't recall the other part of this day, because I'm writing it on January 20th.
==January 18th, 2024==
Today I finally started my day exactly how I wanted. I woke up at 5:30 am, did a quick stretching, did some morning duties outside of the house, did my scoliosis routine, had a meditation and breakfast. I had my entire morning routine finished at 6:45 am. It felt awesome.

After the successful morning I did some good job with my homework and reading for my exam. I was even doing stretches between learning process. It was about 10 am and I had a lot of job done, so I decided to take a little break and... 
... 
...I wasted almost the entire day. The only useful things, that I have done during the rest of the day are taking an English lesson, training and providing some help to my parents.

It seems that there is a clear pattern.
1) When I wake up early the chances of having a "good day" are higher (it was obvious, but still);
2) First hours of the day is a groundwork for the whole day (once again, it is a common knowledge, but, for some reason, I ignore it all the time);
3) I am way too sensitive to my weak decisions. When I allow myself to take an easy path, break my rules a bit, my whole system of control breaks into pieces. With each "weak" decision, it is easier to do the next one.

Just to clarify: I see nothing wrong about having some leisure time, but there should be some principles. 

For example, I decided to take a 20 minute break to watch some anime. It is fine, it was a conscious decision. The problem starts when I spend 30 minutes instead of 20. Those 10 minutes of extra time are not a problem. The weak decision is the problem. I told that I will stop after 20 minutes, but did not. I broke my promise to myself. It leads to a few outcomes: it damages my believe to myself, causes a feel of regret and undermines my respect to my rules (they can be broken).

Honesty is one of the most important values for me and still I constantly lie to myself, I got tired of this. 

For now my plan is simple, I will create some precise rules. I will have a right to change the rules for the next day if it is needed, but I will have to finish the day under given rules, no matter what.

Tomorrow I will use a timer to measure my work periods. After each work session I will have an opportunity to choose the amount of time for leisure. I will use a specific app, It is impossible to extend a break time in it, you can choose the duration only one time after your work session. I will have to pay for this leisure time with my Habitica coins according to my rates. I will also have a right to spend as much time as I want (for free) on stretching and other activities without electronic devices.

I know, that those rules are way too easy to follow, but I think that it would be better to follow easy rules than breaking the hard ones.
==January 19th, 2024==
Today I woke up quite late. I did my morning routine, cooked one dish to take some problems out of my mother's plate and had a training. After that I was expecting my friends to visit me. They did, but, unexpectedly, my sister, her husband and my nephew came at the same time as my friends did. Spending time with my family and friends took quite a lot of time, so I was able to only do the Habitica call, English lesson and write this note. I aim for a long term development, so I will prioritise my sleep.

By the way, my nephew is going to spend a night at our place.

During the Habitica call I choose the same goals I had during the previous week. I did that because I just didn't feel like I have achieved them. Though I think that It would be better to choose something, the progress in which is easier to measure.

During the upcoming week I want to:
1) Have at least 5 days, when I fall asleep and wake up on time.
2) I am currently learning at one online course to prepare for my math exam. Currently I have 20% of progress. I want to have 30-40% of progress by the end of this week.
3) I want to read at least part number 5 of the book "Crime and Punishment" (5 chapters).

A pinch of gratitude:
- It is good that I put my sleep above other things.
- Technically speaking, I did not break any of the rules, that I have created for myself yesterday.
- I'm glad that I got to spend some time with my family and friends.
- My trainings are consistent.
- The Habitica call was interesting, I am happy, that I'm a part of this party.

==January 20th, 2024==
Today I spend quite a lot of time helping my parents and playing with my nephew. Today my father wanted to setup the electricity generator, that we brought home on January 17th. I was helping him. He believed that it would take almost no time. Just as expected, It took more hours than we expected it to take. Even after all this time, it did not start to work.

All those activities took quite a lot of time, but I managed to do an ok amount of work. I finally did some progress with my math preparation, was reading a book (not the one for the exam), had a training, an English lesson, a bit of homework and felt asleep in time. I did a bit of everything, but I still consider it to be a progress.

I also spend some time training with my nephew. He is 10. Each time he spends some time at my place I'm doing that and each time we met again it appears, that he lost all the progress and training form and we start from the scratch. I know that he is 10, but it is still frustrating. I hope that I'm not being too strict with him.

Gratitude moment:
1) I'm grateful to myself for helping my parents;
2) for being patient;
3) for taking care of my nephew;
4) for respecting the rules, that I set for myself earlier;
5) for going to bed early.

==January 21st, 2024==
Today I woke up at 7:20 (which is almost early from my measurements). Usually it would be a hallmark of a good day, but it was not the case today. 

In the morning I allowed myself to break the rules a bit and watch some silly videos on youtube. My youtube is set the way, that it throws me away after 5 minutes of use. Even with that, I was opening it over and over again. The worst part about this kind of situations is that you don't rest or enjoy it, it just drains your energy away.

Throughout the day I had that temptation go back there to that circle of self-destruction again. In some way, I can say that by all those actions I was growing up my habit of disrespecting rules (I violate them many times before! Nothing outrageous happened! It is a normal thing to do). We are forming a habit of missing good habits when we act like this. Someone from our party was bringing up this idea before, but I don't recall who exactly did that.

During the day I was teaching my nephew English, it seems, that he got some progress out of it. At about 4 pm my nephew went back home.

During the last few days I had a lot of visitors and spend a lot of time being lazy. Because of this, today, I had to work of my project for Synergy university at night. I finished it. I don't even know what to say, it took only about 4-6 hours to finish this project, but I was postponing it for a few weeks, that's just lame and shameful. 

Switching to something positive, gratitude:
1) I finally finished my project. The mere fact of this debt was draining energy out of me, I'm happy, that I solved this problem.
2) I continue preparing for my math exam.
3) My English lessons are consistent.

==January 22nd, 2024==
This day was quite average, I managed to do a few useful things, but I also violated my rules a few times today (I set these rules in the daily note for January 18th). My problem is that in the moment of hesitation I'm way too good when it comes to finding excuses for small rule breakers. I think that the key is to stop taking those allowances as something trivial (sure, it is an easy on the paper, but when you are in the moment, it is quite an ordeal, at least for me)

Positive highlights:
1) I finally completed all main goals for the day (math, Crime and Punishment and sleep). For some reason, I was missing one or two pieces on each day.
2) I had a good workout today.
3) I was helping my parents today.
4) I analize my mistakes, it is good.

==January 23rd, 2024==
Today I did a bit of progress and a bit of rule breakers, nothing to be strongly frustrated or proud about. 

At the moment, I don't have many hard things, that I have to do right now. The homework from college is mostly about writing summaries of lectures, I have a break time at the course of Synergy university and preparation for the exam on February 7th goes smoothly. 

However, I find this type of situation to be the most dangerous. Even when I don't have some strict deadlines in the nearest time, the wave of a hellish amount of work is going to cover me in just a few month: learning practices, searching for the compony for the production practice and working there, new module of Synergy university course, my diploma, the exams from my college and another 3 exams in May (the ones, that I need to go through, because of the shift of the education system in our country). Oh... I almost forgot, after that I will have to find a job and/or chose and get to university, move from my home and deal with a military office.

Basically, at one hand I have no strict deadlines right now, what causes a dangerous temptation to relax, and the stress from the upcoming ordeals, that I will have to undertake (to undertake the/an ordeal - a flex way of saying, that you have completed a really hard work).

Anyway, at a (O ^ n) time I will say, that I have to prioritise my sleep and be more disciplined. 

P.S: (O ^ n) equals approximately to "way too much to count".

It's time to scrape together some reason to be proud about myself:
1) I write my daily notes every day (except January 12th, but I'll fix it later);
2) it seems, that I don't blame myself as much as I did before;
3) I wrote down some of my worries, I think, that it will help me to understand myself better;
4) My sleeping schedule got a bit better.

==January 24th, 2024== 
It was not a productive day, quite the opposite, I did only the bare minimum. I hope that I will be able to spend the next day the way to be proud about, it is really important to me.

Anyway, I also want to talk a bit about Robert's idea:

> Not sure if I could call myself depressed, but when I don't sleep enough, I also feel extremely insecure and anxious about everything, and cannot even really talk to people. Also programming becomes quite of an impossible task... I never noticed how much sleep affects my life until I got that job.
> 
> Missing out on all the events has also been quite of a breaking point for me. I suppose it's a mindset thing? Something you will get used to when you truly think through what your priorities are with things.

 It is so good when you know yourself, know what is really important. I think, that I know what principles I want to use to lead my actions, but this alone doesn't do a trick for me. Just a clarity with understanding of what I need to do at the exact moment is not enough, because I usually don't do this. And that is the worst part: I know, that when I am being true to my promises, It feels awesome. I can work and rest plenty, and be happy about this, but, for some stupid reasons, it is hard to act this way.
 
 P.S: I am not trying to make a victim out of myself, I'm just being a bit extra dramatic. After all, I need to prepare for my essay exam ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

I hope that in the future I will have a lot of days, when it won't be hard to came up with gratitude:
- I shared my mind, it feels better now;
- I continue doing my scoliosis exersises everyday;
- I successfully do my English repetitions every day;
- I did my math learning routine today.

==January 25th, 2024==
Today was my birthday. For some reason I wanted to do my best in this very day more than in any other one. For some reason, I just want to grab into any date or source of motivation to name it a milestone of a "new me".

It was not a bad day. I did not accomplish much, but I think that I did good. I spend some time with my friend and to help my father prepare to the road to my granny (Alina lives quite far away and the way there is always a bit stressful). I also wasted some time on doing nothing, but this time I was not using my phone, I was just laying and gathering my strength to start working. I think, that is can be considered a progress. 

This day was good, but not great. I hope, that I will finish my next birthday note with words "I am proud of the way, how I spend this day and year".

Being grateful today was a bit easier:
- I completed all of my 3 main goal for today (sleep, math and the book);
- I was not lying to myself today;
- I had a good training;
- Time that is spend with my friends is a good spent time.

By the way, one of the problems that is in my way of falling asleep at the right time is my habit of writing my daily notes at the very end of the day. Feel free to stick at me if I didn't send my daily note until 9:00 pm (6pm GMT).
==January 26th, 2024==
Yesterday I praised myself for completing all of my main goals. Right after I wrote that note I successfully managed to procrastinate for a few hours in a row instead of sleeping. Today I was trying to compensate that time by sacrificing a part of my sleep. Unsurprisingly, it was not a good idea. I think that it was one of the reasons why I wasted most of today. 

Eehhh... I need to make up some kind of a grattitute. Let's go with aaaaeeehh... a usual set:
- I had a two hours long English/Russian lesson;
- I was present during my online classes (though I do it every day);
- I did my training and scoliosis stretches (nothing original, but still);
- I spend a bit more time then usual on a call to my granny;
- I write my daily notes every day;
- I hope that I will be able to praise myself for completing my reading today.

By the way, I wrote this note later then I should have (I should have done it before 6 pm GMT), sorry for that.

==January 27th, 2024== 
I woke up quite late today. I was blaming myself for that. It was hard to complete my morning routine, everything seemed pointless, because I would not be able to achieve a "good" day scenario. Because of all this I wasted a lot of time and it took me about 3 hours to complete my morning routine. However, I managed to put it together and spend the second half of the day with more consciousness.

Today we had a third Habitica call. Here are my main goals for the next week:
1) Have at least 5 days, when I fall asleep and wake up on time.
2) Get to the "45% complete" mark on my math course.
3) Read 6 chapters of the book "Crime and Punishment"

Bonus task: remind Robert to complete his sleeping goals.

The domain of gratitude:
- I had one hour long English lesson and more than 100 minutes of Habitica call. That is a lot of English practice, this is good.
- I will fall asleep on time today (almost).
- I was able to break up the cycle of procrastination in the second half of the day;
- At the moment I call my dad and two grandmothers everyday, it's a good thing.
==January 28th, 2024==
Today I managed to read and record 2 chapters of Crime and Punishment. It is not much, but, for some reason, I'm usually able to handle only 1 or 0. 

During the recording process I run into one problem. 

I will not say that the first recording was great, but it was rather of the good side. The next chapter was really good, so I wanted to make the breakdown of it even better than the one for the previous chapter. There is nothing bad about the desire to improve, but in this case I was aiming for perfection, it is not good, because those breakdowns (recordings) are meant to be a quick way to:
1) practice my ability to speak on English;
2) find mistakes in my oral speech latter;
3) express and save my emotions about the material. 

I spend quite a lot of time trying to record the "perfect" beginning. Further more after I failed to record something, that will satisfy me and decided to humble my ambition, I was not able to start the process. I wasted quite a lot of time procrastinating because of this feeling of my silliness and dissatisfaction. 

Anyway, I decided to make some rules for myself:
- I will have only 3 attempts for each chapter/episode/ whatever_I_am_talking_about. 
- I can restart the recording only if it lasts less than a minute. 

I also find myself constantly breaking the rules, that I made for myself, they are written in the note for January 18th. I think, that the rules are good enough, but I don't respect them much at this point. I think, that I will came up with a new plan in the next few days.

Thankfulness:
1) I believe that I will be able to fall asleep today on time, like REALLY on time, at about 10 pm;
2) I read two chapters of Crime and Punishment today, that is good;
3) I did quite a good amount of homework today;
4) It seems (at least to me), that I got better at finding the "roots" of my mistakes.

==January 29th, 2024==
Do you remember how yesterday I told that I would go to bed before 10pm? I... have... (Mikhail is trying to avoid swear words)... experienced a failure with that. Because of this I woke up at about 9:40 am. I had a lot things to do and I wanted to fall asleep on time today, so I consciously decided to not hope to read a chapter of Crime and Punishment. 

Training
___
During the workout I found myself weaker than usual. People say that it is a normal thing to have these days every once in a while, but usually I'm quite stable with my training results in almost every exercise.

The only exercise in which I'm quite inconsistent is handstand. For some reason it is hard for me to find a balance. In some days I show some relatively decent results, but, in general, I progress really slow. I think, that I need to devote more time to this skill, maybe, do some corrections to the way I train and be more patient.

Light bulb
___
A couple of days before the light bulb in our coop (the place where people keep their chickens) stopped working. We didn't have the right bulb at the moment and got it only today. 

I changed the light bulb, but it didn't work. There was a socket inside, it worked. It would be a huuuuge understatement to say, that the wiring in that place was not done in a clear way, so it took me some time to find a root of the problem (compare to this wire even my code can be called clear (trust me, it says a lot)). 

The solution was extremely simple, but I was constantly forgetting something at home, so it took me more time that I would want to admit. 

___
I wouldn't call this day to be fruitless, but I could have done better. 

It's time to give this little boy some gratitude:
1) Even if that piece of work with electricity was simple, it was still my first time, so I should probably thank myself for my efforts.
2) I will go to bed on time today. This. Time. For. Sure... Probably. I hope.
3) I'm doing my meditation before sleep everyday.

==January 30th, 2024==
I'll try (the key word) to keep it short, because at this point I should have already been sleeping.

This day started quite promising, but, overall, it was not successful. I wasted an extreme amount of time. In the middle of the day the electricity was turned off, but it was given back again. 

Today I got a message from my classroom teacher, I need to hurry up with starting working on my diploma project. I also need to start working on my essay for the English olympic (I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but I need to write one until 20th of February).

January is drawing to its end and I need to write a few notes about this month, I hope that I will be able to start doing it tomorrow.

An attempt of gratitude:
- I was learning math for my exam today.
- I did my training (as always).
- I had one hour long English lesson.
- I gave a call to my dad and grannies.

==January 31st, 2024==
Today was a nice day. It was not perfect, but it was good enough. The last piece to a good day will be falling asleep on time, so I'll better just hurry up go to bed. I will not write almost any details, this day was just nice. If that is the only thing, that I will remember about this day, that it is good enough for me.

A slice of gratitude:
- I completed all three of my main goals for today (reading, math and sleep);
- I read not 1, but 2 chapters of Crime and Punishment today;
- I will finally fall asleep on time.
- I am grateful to myself for being able to be so grateful to myself.
- I am grateful to myself for being able to be grateful for being able to be so grateful to myself.
-  I am grateful to myself for being able to be grateful for being able to be so grateful for being able to be so grateful to myself.
