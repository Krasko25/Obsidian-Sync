### February 2024
==February 1st, 2024==

I can not call this day to be successful, but there were a few good moments. For example, I finally write one of the essays that I was owning to my English teacher. I promised to write another one tomorrow. 

Anyway, today I will write my gratitude for everything that I have done during January 2024.
- I want to thank Mikhail for all the efforts during this month.
- I think that I was able to be more grateful to Mikhail during this month, I'm grateful for that.
- There was made some efforts to prepare for my exam on February 7th, such as making up essays and reading Crime and Punishment.
- I am grateful to Mikhail for being able to deal with stress better than usual.
- Mikhail did quite a few adjustments to his training program, nice job.
- Mikhail decided to made his health his highest priority while creating a new training program. Some of the new exercises could not be as effective from the perspective of muscle volume, but he overpowered his ego anyway. Thanks for that.
- Mikhail is trying to regulate his sleeping schedule, it is really important.
- Mikhail has already start his preparation for a math exam. Of course, he spends not much time on it, but it is still some progress.
- Awesome Habit Party started doing Habitica calls and other things for accountability. Of course it is not directly result of his actions, but he is still grateful for everything and everyone involved (including himself).
- Thanks to Mikhail for writing notes every day. Though, I think, that he should try to keep it shorter in the future.
- Maybe Mikhail forgot something, but, anyway, I'm grateful to him for not being troubled about that.

==February 2nd, 2024==
Today was not a successful day, but there were a few highlights. Let's talk about them in gratitude form:
- I wrote another essay for the upcoming exam (though I finished it quite late), just as I promised. This one seems to be not bad at the moment.
- I have this bad habit of mine, I postpone (delay) the completion of my physical education homework to the last day before a deadline. It happens because I really don't like doing this subject. The thing is that our PE teacher is quite strict and gives a bald amount of homework. And the worth part that this PE homework has nothing to do with physical activity! It's just a paper work! Spending 60 or 90 minutes to do a homework for physical education, on the subject that is supposed to be easy and funny... it's fells just... unfair. I know that my own expectation is the problem here, but still. Aaanyyway, all this looong explanation was necessary for the context of gratitude, sorry for that. Today I was supposed to do my homework for PE, that I was delaying to the end of the week, but this time was different. Just imagine how happy I was when I found out that I have already done this homework on Monday!! Sure, it's a small thing, but for some reason it inspired me a lot. Because of such small Ws (W - win) I find myself wanting do everything on time.
- Just as I do every day, I spend some time with my dog. Usually I tend to forget it, but it's such a lovely creature. I grateful for noticing it again.

My plans for February:
- start doing my diploma until February 10th;
- build a stable sleeping schedule (10 pm - 6 am);
- successfully pass my exam of February 7th;
- start preparing for my Russian exam in May (or June, I'm not totally sure when it happens).
- finish my math course and start the next one.
- be proud of myself.
- I want to follow the rules, that I will list below.

Here are my new set of rules about leisure time:
1. Rest without electronic devises is unlimited (I don't think that I will lose much time on that).
2. Stretching in the leisure time is HIGHLY commended.
3. Small pauses to stretch, go to toilet or to drink water can be done in any time (even in the middle of pomodoro).
4. Here are my daily allowance:
- Youtube - 2 sets of 15 minutes (I will not forbid watching shorts, but I don't think, that I would want to spend this time like this)
- "Useful" videos of Youtube. By that I mean videos, that are supposed to be useful, but, in most cases, they contain very little of useful information ("Why do you need to count calories", "The problem with active recall technique", etc). 2 sets of 15 minutes.
- Entertainment content, that I need to breakdown in English after consuming - 60 minutes, that can be divided to parts equal to 15 of 30 minutes (time, that I spend to do voice recordings do not count). P.S: there are a few anime and mangas that we studying with my English teacher.
- Entertainment context - 2 sets of 30 minutes and 3 sets of 10 minutes
5. Rules for using the allowance:
- I'm allowed to use any media for unlimited time if it's necessary for studying (for example, a youtube video about solving some problem in a code)
- I can use a set of allowance only after some work done (pomodoro, training or English).
- I can use only 1 set after one piece of work.
- I can NOT change to duration or type of allowance piece after starting the timer.
- If I have some allowance in the end of the day, I can save it for tomorrow, however (!), I can save only one set.
6. Limitations from above was no power when I spend time with friends

The reason why I stopped using coins from Habitica because my earnings are way too inconsistent. I also wanted to have a system, that would engage me to consume an entertainment content, that I will have to breakdown in English. However, I still want to use Habitica coins to motivate me in some way. It would be a great pleasure for me if someone recommends me a way to do that.

P.S. (for LD): Habitica is a program for tracking your habits and tasks. The feature of this app is that it is similar to a game. When you complete your tasks or habits, you get coins, experience (to lvl up your character) and different stuff. You can use coins to buy rewards for yourself (for example, 15 minutes of watching youtube can worth 30 coins).
==February 3rd, 2024==
Today I was acting according to the rules, that I stated yesterday. I think that. was doing good, however, I was not able to do a great amount of things because I woke up at 8:10 am and there was a birthday party of my brother. 

The Habitica call today was quite interesting. For the first time we were using web cameras. I decided that making an estimated road map for my Diploma and passing my exam on Wednesday are going to my my main goals for the week.

I think that we also forgot to talk about cleaning during the Habitica call (or, maybe, people were talking it after I left). I completed my cleaning goal only half way, but I will fix it and send photos tomorrow.

Some gratitude to Mikhail:
- Mikhail knows, that respecting rules all the time is really important to make them useful. He is doing it good for now.
- Mikhail felt asleep on time.
- Mikhail is making preparation for his exam on Wednesday every day.
