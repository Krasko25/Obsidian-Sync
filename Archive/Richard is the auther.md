[[The Secret History]]
[[Richard]]: I used to date one girl, let's call her Kathy. Why did he say is like this? Was he trying to hide her name? Even when there is a story about murders?

> [[Richard]]: I'm sorry, as well, to present such a sketchy and disappointing exegesis of what is in fact the central part of my story. I have noticed that even the most garrulous and shameless of murderers are shy about recounting their crimes... In a certian way, though, I know how my colleague feels. "Not that everything went black", nothing of the sort; only that the event itself is cloudy, because of some primitive numbing effect that obscured it at the time; the same effect, I suppose that enables panicked mothers to swim icy rivers, or rush into burning houses, for a child; the effect that occasionally allows a deeply bereaved person to make it though a funeral without a single tear. 

Who is he writing to? A reader?
