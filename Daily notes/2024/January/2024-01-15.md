1. Why so many people are still “computer illiterate”?
It happens because a lot of people are scared to try something new and there is no people around them, who are willing to explain everything with patience.

2. What are the most important applications of computer?
The answer is different for everyone, but for me it is browser (program that is needed to comfortably access global network), IDE's (programs, that allow me to comfortably write my code) and social networks.

3. Are computer games just a waste of time or is it a nice hobby and a lot of fun?
It is really hard to define, what 'a waste of time' is. What is the purpose of life, what is a successful life? Only if you know the answers to those questions, you can know what is a 'waste of time'. 

For me, if you are able to keep computer games as a hobby and not to spend too much time on it, then it is fine.

4. What do you use the computer for?
I use it to study in college, to learn programming, to entertain myself and even to read books.
