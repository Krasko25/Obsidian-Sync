Richard and the twins were talking about Henry and Bunny, who actually were a good friend. Suddenly one of the twins pointed at the grave yard and started talking about how beautiful it is. As well he told, how beautiful this flowers, especially in the winter. 

It is interesting, because Bunny and Henry are the ones to die at that year, from the same hands. The twins were talking about how beautiful this sight is.

The twins found apples in the grave yard to be beautiful and special. They were able to enjoy only this ones, the ones that are near to death, even when the were a lot of the same apples in Hampden. Because of their twisted minds, they were not able to enjoy common things.
