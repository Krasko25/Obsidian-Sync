### January
==January 1st, 2023==
Recently I started learning about one topic, about ego. Usually we are told, that it is a bad thing. However, is it really possible for one to improve oneself without ego? 

Let's say that you want to win a school championship. For that you need to believe in yourself, believe, that you worth that. You also need to be ready to overstep a lot of people with the same ambitions. Isn't it arrogant to believe that you are better than all these people, to put your ambitions above others?

SOoou, as it seems to me, I have more accomplishments that an average person of my age, but I am not satisfied with myself, I think that I can and have to be much better. Isn't that greedy? Should I find a way to improve and rase to my standards or I should lower them (standards) and settle with what I'm now?

P.S: I know, that the right answer is to move forward and love myself for all my wins and loses at the same time, but it's kind of hard.
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, to do either of those things I need to change and to change I need to use the strong sides of my personality. In this note I will try to find them.

My trump cards (and how to improve them):
1) My values are going along with self-improvement.
- ability to accept everything as it is - sometimes I'm able to act according to this philosophy and it feels awesome, but for that I need to be more conscious with my actions and thoughts. Meditation is a great training for that.
- being open to a new experience - It is hard to train this, but I, once again, need to be more conscious so I don't miss those opportunities to widen my worldview.
- being honest - when it comes to self-improvement, the most important part is to be honest to yourself, keep your promises to yourself. That is the tricky part for me, It is easy for me to keep my promises to other people, but I constantly let myself down. I have read an article, that told, that your believe in yourself strongly depends on the fact of how often you lie to yourself. In other words, to trust and be confident in yourself, you need to keep your words to yourself.
- being mentally strong. It does sound silly, but this idea really inspires me.
2) It is easier for me to do things for other people. Is it because I'm kind? Or I care too much about others opinion? Or I need people's gratitude to feel good about myself? Or, maybe, I just was raised in this way? Anyway, I can abuse it in some way.
3) I have a lot of ambitions. Of course, it does not sound like a big advantage, but I met an awful lot of people of my age, who did not care about their future.
4) I'm flexible (I don't mean easily adaptive, of course, it is always takes me a lot of time to get used to new rules). What I mean is my ability and willingness to embrace new information and to alter my perception about the world and myself.
5) My achievements inspire me a lot. In the moments when I do well with something, it makes me want to keep going. The better I do, the more inspiration I get (though, maybe, it works like this for everyone ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

Maybe I have forgotten something, but I already want to go to bed.

==January 3rd, 2023==
For the last few days I was not awfully productive. It happened for many reason, of them is because I started watching a new anime (I'm not recording it in English). It was always hard for me to do small amount of things per a time. When it comes to entertainment contents I either consume nothing or an awful amount. I put some limitation rules for myself, let's see if it works.

I was delaying my year plans for a few days already. I will do my best to write about it tomorrow.
==January 4nd, 2023==
In this note I will try to sum up the results of the last year. I will use my old daily notes to do that.

First thing that I noticed is the inconsistency of my notes, in some months I was writing less than 1 note per a week. This aspect was improved greatly. The quality and length of notes has improved as well. I started writing more about my feelings and plans, make up some conclusions and takeaways from my experienсes. I consider this to be a really important improvement.

Let's talk about the way how I started each of those years. I totally can not name my start of this year to be successful, but it is way better than the start of one. I have done more work. Each of the notes from the last year up to January 25th is full of regrets. I became not only more productive, but, more importantly, also more positive.

At January of previous year I decided to meditate on a stable basis and progress in that. I still did not achieve the good results in this direction, especially when it comes to quality. This information is something between "really funny" and "depressing" to me. Obviously, I'm exaggerating my disappointment, but it is still not a good result. I need to work in that direction.

I read many note from this year and was surprised, I was always writing about things that went wrong and almost never about why and how to change/avoid it (maybe, I was thinking about it, but was not expressing my thoughts in text). I started to dig deeper only recently. I will do my best to keep moving in that direction.

Some of interesting things, that I have experienced during this year:
- my attempt to work on the project with Mikhail Georgievich and other people. We were trying to create a program for decision analysis. I made a program with Saaty method. However, we were not able to get a grant for developing this project because of slow work with documentation from the side of university.
- Some adventures that I had to go through because I lost my phone.
- My trip to Novgorod the Great.
- The time that I spend taking care of my granny.
- The week without electricity and internet.

I'm grateful to this note, because of it I found out that I have made some progress not only with my studying, but also with my mindset.

Daily portion of gratitude: 
- I'm grateful to myself for the fact that I renewed my habit of reading books ("Crime and Punishment" doesn't count, because it is not stable),
- for my work on my new training system, that will be better for my health,
- for the fact, that I finally started my preparation for the math exam,
- for being a bit more conscious,
- for going to bed earlier, than usually.
