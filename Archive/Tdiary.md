### February 2024
==February 1st, 2024==

I can not call this day to be successful, but there were a few good moments. For example, I finally write one of the essays that I was owning to my English teacher. I promised to write another one tomorrow. 

Anyway, today I will write my gratitude for everything that I have done during January 2024.
- I want to thank Mikhail for all the efforts during this month.
- I think that I was able to be more grateful to Mikhail during this month, I'm grateful for that.
- There was made some efforts to prepare for my exam on February 7th, such as making up essays and reading Crime and Punishment.
- I am grateful to Mikhail for being able to deal with stress better than usual.
- Mikhail did quite a few adjustments to his training program, nice job.
- Mikhail decided to made his health his highest priority while creating a new training program. Some of the new exercises could not be as effective from the perspective of muscle volume, but he overpowered his ego anyway. Thanks for that.
- Mikhail is trying to regulate his sleeping schedule, it is really important.
- Mikhail has already start his preparation for a math exam. Of course, he spends not much time on it, but it is still some progress.
- Awesome Habit Party started doing Habitica calls and other things for accountability. Of course it is not directly result of his actions, but he is still grateful for everything and everyone involved (including himself).
- Thanks to Mikhail for writing notes every day. Though, I think, that he should try to keep it shorter in the future.
- Maybe Mikhail forgot something, but, anyway, I'm grateful to him for not being troubled about that.
