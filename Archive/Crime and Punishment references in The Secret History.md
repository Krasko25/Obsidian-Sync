[[The Secret History]] [[Преступление и наказание]] 
##### Doors
Julian was opening door in the same manner as [[Алёна Ивановна]], without trust, as if we is waiting for something horrible to happen. 

When Richard paid a visit to him for the first time, Julian opened the door slightly. 

On the second time, he opened door more, but there still was emphasis on it. 

As well, I remember, that he was doing the same, when our company came to him and got that letter.
##### [[Live is show, tragedy]]
While reading Crime and Punishment (2x6), I noticed, that when Раскольников, was trying to "show his tongue", to turn himself in, he was trying to make a show out of it. He used such an epic words as "заявляю", "признаюсь", "свидетельствую", etc.

Simply put, for Раскольников the opinion of other people is really important, he constantly tries to turn himself in, to put himself in danger. Sure, it is different from Henry's behavior, but I still find that to be some kind of inspiration or reference.
