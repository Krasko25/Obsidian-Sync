[[The Secret History]] [[Bunny]] Bunny for some reason is quite able to close his eyes on reality. He often does not see the real opinion of people about him, the reality of the situation. It is quite strange, in a lot of cases he is able to read people to manipulate them and belittle them. I guess that it is his protective mechanism.

The waiter was sarcastic with Bunny and Richard, he did not believe that they will be able to close the bill. However, Bunny was not paying any attention to that.

In the restaurant, he felt no shame about the situation and he was able to keep a straight face with Henry.
