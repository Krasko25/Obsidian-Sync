### December
==December 1st, 2023==
Today I did better job than yesterday. I finished and send a new part of the course work to the teacher. Of course, I did all my house duties (washing clothes, heating the oven, injections, cooking, etc). As well, today I did a good job cleaning. I need to spend some time on that, because the house was in a quite a bad state, when I got here. If I keep this up in the same rhythm, the house will be in an acceptable state in about a week.

I decided to postpone my monthly note to tomorrow, because I'm short of time and I don't want to do it just to get it over with.
==December 2nd, 2023==
Today I did almost no progress nor in my course work or cleaning, I even had to delay my english lesson (usually I do them almost every day (I'm writing these explanations, because I will send some part of this text to my Habitica community)). Honestly, this time I can't even blame myself for that, this day was full of unexpected problems.

I decided to delay my dinner, because I felt weak and had no appetite. My grandmother wanted to take a bath. Usually wipe her off. However, this time she decided to take a full (полноценную) bath. The bath in her house is quite large and high. My granny weight 1.5 as much as I do, so it took about 45 minutes to get her inside. I knew for sure, that it would be nearly impossible for me to take her out of the bath by myself, so I placed a chair inside, if she would lay down. That is why I placed a chair inside the bath. At first, everything went well, but then, my granny decided to lay down anyway, she was way too persistent.

As time went by I was feeling worse and worse, but I was ignoring it, because I had larger problem to come. Obviously, my granny was not able to get out of the bath. We decided to take a strategy of raising the level of the bath by slipping clothes under her. We straggled more than an hour. By that point, I was no longer able to ignore my well-being, I started to throw up. As well, I had diarrhea. 

At about 16:45 we both were exhausted. My granny decided that we both needed to sleep. She was already on the bunch of clothes, so I had to just cover her with a blanket. I was vomiting for a long time before I was able to fall asleep. At about 11:30 pm we both woke up and it took us about an hour to get her to the bed. After that I felt asleep again. Right now I feel way better.
==December 5th, 2023==
A few weeks ago I signed up for exams, that were necessary for me to get to university. They were not sure about the subjects that I would need to learn or time of examination (it is kind of not examination to university, but I don't want to explain it, because it is quite complicated). They promised to call me after November 15th. They didn't. At November 26th (or about so), I had to urgently move to my granny and switch places with my dad who was taking care of her. (this information was necessary for the context)

Today I got some unexpected news. Tomorrow at 9 am I will have to pass examination at my home town. I'm not prepared for exams, because I was not told what subject I will need to pass and when... and It is more than 650km away... and I need a few days to book tickets... and I can't live my granny alone...

Anyway, I will have to urgently move back after my father gets here. One of my friends told me, that there will be an opportunity to retake exam, if they find my reasons to be valid.
==December 6th, 2023==
###### Monthly note (the one, that I had to write at December 1st)

My goals:
1. advance with my meditation;
2. be more conscious;
3. finish my course work until December twelve;
4. do my homework for my online studying in university in time;
5. finish this month without any tail (nor in Synergy university or Technical School);

8. do at least 5 Crime and Punishment recordings;
9. add a couple of new exercises to my English lessons;

2. short videos;
3. moving home;
4. I'm not sure if I will be allowed to retake my Russian exams.

Today I was going to the local shop to buy some stuff for my grandmother. There were a lot of items. After I got back, she asked about the juice. I lied and said, that there was no juice available. I immediately regretted my words, it is really important to me to be honest. Usually, I'm easily able to tell the truth, even I'm ashamed of it. I value such moments as this one, because it reminds me about the fact, that I have a lot to work on.

In the nearest few days, my father is going to switch places with me. I need to work extra hard to clean the house, do house duties and to catch up on my studying. Of course, I can catch up after my fathers arrival. However, I was planning to build my regime and discipline before that. However, I just don't want to rely on that, I have already promised to myself to build my regime and discipline before that and, to be completely honest, I would hurt my ego too much, if I can't combine my house duties and studying. Of course, I don't see anything bad about taking help from others, but it is a bit different case, I'm sure, that I not doing my best and that I could handle it myself.

> [!success] Self-cultivation

Right now I have an awfully lot of things to do. I need to finish my course work, take care of my granny, prepare for my Russian exam that will happen in December 15, do learning practice assignments, learn in an online course in university. The worst part about this is that most of my problems or, probably, all of them, are stemming from my own mistakes. I have postponed a lot of things and now, they are coming after me.

Of course, I know, that I have what I have, that there were reasons for every action that led me to this point. Still, I can't help, but to think, that I want myself to be different. I want myself to be able to handle all of this without wavering and, maybe, even warn all of this beforehand.

For some reason, I don't find myself in panic. Sure, I want to be someone, who can face problems with a strong mind, without wavering, but something is off. Am I relatively calm because I am strong or I just don't care anymore? Am I just loosing my heart, giving up? I don't know, it scares me.

Anyway, I guess, that I need to sacrifice something to do more important stuff. Of course, I can't buy time through taking bad care of my grandmother. My learning practice length until December 21st, my exam is at December 15th. I can give up on making learning practice assignments in time for now, course work and examination are more important.
==December 9th, 2023==
Tomorrow my dad arrives. Most of the day I spend in preparations, I cleaned the house to a bearable state and cook a good amount of food. To be honest, I don't know why I'm doing this extra job even when I have a lot of more important stuff to do. Of course, I can say, that it is a showcase of my love or something like this. Sure, partially, it is true, but the believe that there are other reasons. Am I doing this because I need some kind of praise? Is it that important to me, or, maybe, It is another way of procrastination? I'm not sure.
==December 10th, 2023==
My father arrived at about 10 am. I helped him to move everything. I was not able to do all the cleaning that I was planning to do, but it was enough to surprise him anyway. I fed him, he liked the food. Usually, I'm able to enjoy cooking only when I have free time to not hurry and enjoy the process, but this time, I was able to do that even with given circumstances. I also helped him a few times with other businesses throughout the day. 

Sadly, I have to recognise, that today I did almost nothing useful, other than helping my father. I had a lot of time, but I was not able to start working on anything.

Today was planed a lesson with my English teacher. At the moment, she was helping me to prepare for my Russian exam. I was not able to contact her, she was not online. I am really worried, because there is a military action near our country, something serious could have happened.
==December 11th, 2023==
Today was able to combine helping my father with my solving my own problems. I can't say, that I did not waste any time, but, still, it was quite a productive day. I finally finished the practical part of my course work. A lot of paper work is ahead, but I hope, that I will be able to finish it tomorrow or the day after (it will be hard to achieve, but I'll do my best).

I found out, why I was not able to contact my English teacher nor yesterday or today. She has problems with electricity. It seems that for a while I will not be able to contact her. Because of that, the preparation for the exam is promising to be more challenging.
==December 12th, 2023==
Tomorrow I will have a move to another place, I need to leave to granny because of the exam, that will happen at December 15th. I had a great plans for today. First of all, I needed to pack my things and finish my course work. A large part of the day I was working on that. However, I was  also doing some other stuff throughout the day. I carried one ton of coal to house and helped my father to install a washer. I also had a webinar at online university course today.

I am departing tomorrow early at the morning. I decided to finish my course work today. To be honest, there is no specific reason, why I have to finish it exactly today. However, the teacher, that is responsible for course work, did not state a deadline and I can say for sure, is that I have missed all the recommended terms. At any moment she can wrap things up, so I can not prepare for the upcoming exam peacefully. 

I made a decision to not sleep this night and finish my course work. I will be able to catch up on my sleep in the bus. Maybe, this is not a good decision, but, probably, this one is the best from the given ones.
==December 13th, 2023==
I wasn't sleeping the whole night in hopes to finish my course work. However, I overstimated my abilities. At this point I have about 60% of the paperwork done. I will also need to make presentation and report for my work. I guess, that I will try to finish it before the exam anyway.

I got to my bus at 6:30 am (it was delayed to this time). Most of the way I was sleeping. I arrived at 4:10 pm to Makeevka, however, the bus to my country departed at 4:55 pm. It was cold outside, so I was not able to prepare for my literature exam.

I will arrive at home at about 5:45 pm. I can't afford the luxury of long rest right now, so I will have a lesson with my teacher to prepare for the exam at 7 pm.
==December 14th, 2023==
Today I was told that my exam was postponed to February 7th. It happened because too many of students were ill. I feel conflicted about this situation. I am glad, that I will have more time for preparation, however, It also means, that I will have to spend a lot of time on preparation for this exam and I will not be able to get over with this exam in the nearest time.

Sadly, today, even when I have way less responsibilities than before, I started to procrastinate a lot. Of course, the exam was postponed, but I still need to deal with my course work, university course learning and learning practice in my technical school.
==December 15th, 2023==
> [!success] Self-cultivation

Today I woke up at 7:20 am. There was no internet until 9:00. I used this time to do my morning routine and the training, that I was supposed to do before dinner. I got free at 9:20 and had the second breakfast (I am currently trying to get some muscle mass and I lost a couple of kilos during that trip to my granny, so it is important for me to eat a lot). I still haven't complete my course work and I was planning to do that today. However, I was wasting time until 11 am, until electricity was turned off.

So, here I'm. It is my third day at home and I am still procrastinating. It happens every time, every time something big happens in my life, it takes me a lot of time to adapt. I need to become more flexible. 

> As the four seasons between heaven and earth flow in an endless cycle, so too, must man work his way, through his own cycles of seasons continuous. If you are able to to endure a long hard winter, a fresh new spring is sure to follow, invigorating with  strength renewed.

It is a quote from one piece of art. For some reasons it inspires me. We all have our weak and strong sides. Sometimes we can be in a great state, have a strong mind, solve all our problems and be happy to do that. However, sometimes, we can despise ourself, the more we regret, the lower we fall. We can never move in one direction, sometimes we rise, sometimes we fall. The reasons behind our decisions and actions are complicated, we fall in the same states again and again. It is normal. What we should do is to be conscious, learn our mistakes and try to be better so the next time we fall not as low and rise even higher. 
==December 16th, 2023==
Yesterday at 11 am electricity was turned off. I have my course work, that I had to complete a long time ago, as well, I have to do about 15 practical assignments for my learning practice to do until the 21st of December. I could not do any of these assignments without internet, further more, my laptop has run out of battery.

At about 10 am of December 16th (in a day after electricity was turned off) I decided to pay a visit to my grandfather. I hoped to do my course work at his place, because I didn't have any time to wait. I had to go at his place without warning, because I was not able to phone him, there was no mobile network.

!!
Let's put all the worldly (мирские) questions aside, today is the historical day. People from Habitica won't understand, but for the last 2 years I was not able to undertake one ordeal, no matter how hard I was trying. It even became some kind of a meme for me.

On December 16th of 2023, 11:30 am at Moscow time I was on the bus stop, the bus was arriving 11:40 am at Moscow time. I was at the bus stop ON TIME and I did NOT even had to run. No wonder there was snow outside. For the last two years I was running to the bus stop, every time I was getting there at the very last second, sometimes I was even missing it. Maybe that was the compensation for all these troubles, maybe all my life was leading to this point.
!!

Back to the land. I got to my grandfather's place (Makeyevka), but there was no electricity in that part of the town as well. My grandfather and his wife were happy to see me, we didn't see each other for a while, so I spend some time there.

My plan B was to go to the place of my mother's sister in the other end of Makeyevka (I don't know, how this kind of relationship is called. For convenience, I will call her Alena. The way to her has proven to be troublesome (mainly because I was going to her place for the first time and I am bad when it comes to directions). 

I was at Alena's place until evening, she was nice to me. Alena is living together with her mom and the apartment is small. Further more, she was tired after her work week, so I decided not to do her any more troubles and leave. However, I was not planning to give up.

I charged my devices in Alena's place beforehand and went back to my grandfather's place (they are quite happy to take me as a guest, so it is not a problem). Sure, there was no electricity, but there was mobile network. I decided to spend that night working on my course work there.
==December 17th, 2023==
There was no electricity in my grandfather's place in Makeyevka (his name is Pasha), however, mobile network was available. I stayed up at night to finish my course work as soon as possible. I managed to do that, but I still needed to do the report and the presentation for my course work. I was not able to do that because my laptop was running out of charge.

I was planning to go to another place to charge my devices, but Pasha offered me his help. He and his wife contacted with a few neighbours who had electricity generators. It didn't work out, but one of my grandfather's friends had a flat with electricity. I gave him my devices. All this running around took a lot of time, but at about 2 pm I got my laptop back.

I finished my report and presentation at about 4 pm, but I was not able to find mobile network to upload my work until 4:30 pm. Pasha wanted me to stay another night there, but I needed to go home. I got there at about 6 pm.
==December 18th, 2023==
I hoped to get electricity fixed until lunch. Of course, it didn't happen and there was no mobile network in my home. I was anticipating this result and wanted to go to my grandmother (not the one I was taking care of. The one that I'm going to in is Nina). There was electricity and internet there. However, it is (still) hard to get there (to Nina) and my mother wanted me to congratulate one girl in the costume of cent Nikolay (christian version of Canta Claus) tomorrow (there was no point in going to my granny for a couple of hours). 

During the day time I went to my friend. He had an electricity generator (yes, I decided to use all my connections), but there was no internet.

My mother decided that we should have congratulated that girl at that night. We did that, I had no particular text or scenario, but this child was excited and pleased. It is fun to do such things, because kids are so emotional, they need so little to be happy (be like kids).

At night I was told that the electricity at Nina's (my granny) place was turned off. I decided to go to my sister's work (Yasinovataya) tomorrow.

> [!Success] Self-cultivation

Today I got to my sister work place, there was light, but no internet. I was hoping to catch some mobile internet. I succeed to do that outside of the building for a few minutes, but, mostly all my attempts were vain. 

My sister told that yesterday there was internet, so I was waiting there until the end of my sister's work day. She gave me a ride to my home.  During that time I was writing English notes, reading books and meditating.

I spend quite a big part of my day reading book about meditation and doing the meditation itself. I liked it a lot. It happened many times to me, I spend some time with more consciousness than usually, enjoy it a lot and then... go back to information noice and other stuff, that makes me feel bad. This time I will try to not repeat the same mistake.

I hope that these experiences will help me to value common opportunities more.

I decided to make a new rule for myself: I will do three conscious breaths before each unlock of my phone.

I got home and found out that Nina (my granny) got electricity and internet turned on at her place today. They were not able to contact me. I just forgot to check this option, I could literally get there without any transport. Nina lives 5 or 6 kilometers away form my sister's work place.

I know that it is a great training for some of my values, I know that I should accept things as they are. However, sometimes, it is just too hard for me to embrace my decisions and not to regret about them.

I all this running around made me realise, how much I need the help of other people. Of course, I had no doubts about that, but this situation made me value my connections even more. Because of these problems, I met and spend a lot of time with important people, I would never find time for that under different circumstances. I guess, one can never know, where his life is leading him.
==December 20th, 2023==
Today I went to my grandmother(Nina). One friend of my mother gave me a ride near my granny. I was not able to contact at the morning. When I came, there was no electricity, mobile network was not available as well. 

My granny decided that we could not just wait for electricity to appear, so we were running from place to place. It took us a lot of time, but we found a spot in the tax office, where we were allowed to use electricity and there was mobile network. However, right after that, we got a phone call from my granny's husband, that electricity and internet appeared in their place. 

We got home around 3:30 pm. I was trying to work at night, but got tired because of all the adventures and fall asleep.

It seems that there will be electricity and internet for about 8 to 12 hours per a day. I think I will be living with my granny for a while.
==December 21st, 2023==
Today light was turned on until 11 am. During the time without internet I wrote some notes, rested and did my training.

I wanted to go to the tax office again, but my granny (Nina) and her husband did not let me go alone, because the were worried. I already knew the way so there was no need for that, but my granny decided to walk me a few kilometers to that place. 

In the middle of the way we got a phone call, electricity appeared. I went back home and was doing my homework for the rest of the day. 
==December 22nd, 2023==
I spend this whole day doing my homework for the learning practice. Today also started online lectures in my technical school. Surely, teachers are not doing full time lessons, but they are still generous with the amount of homework. 

Today I was able to finally contact my English teacher (LD). I was not able to do that for the last 7 days and was worried. I didn't know the exact place she was living in and was moving from place to place, so I was not able check if she was alright. As well, obviously, we were not able to do our lessons. It is quite bad for my preparation for the exam. We will try to make a Russian class tomorrow using mobile network.
==December 23rd, 2023==
> [!Success] Self-cultivation

Today I spend a whole day doing my learning practice assignments, writing summaries for my homework,  taking part in Synergy classes and, for the first time in this long week, in my English/Russian ones.

Today my brother came here as well. There was a barbecue. The electricity and internet finally appeared in my village, I'm going home tomorrow.

My granny, her husband, my grandfather and all other people who took me as a guest were kind to me all this time. They were giving me a good treatment with food, space, other comforts and, of course, a lot of care. Sometimes it seemed as if they cared more than I did. There were no self-interest in their actions, I was not even given an opportunity to do any house duties. They love me sincerely, without any specific reason, unconditionally. I knew this all along, but my perception of this was different. I know that it is silly, but It took me so long to truly feel that, to value it. 

There are many people in this world who love me... need me... appreciate me... believe in me... It makes me happy. 
==December 24th, 2023==
One friend of my mother gave me and my brother a ride to our village. It saved us a lot of time.

My mother had some guests today, I helped with cleaning. At about 7 pm I had a lesson with my teacher (LD). To be honest, other than that, I did almost nothing useful today.
==December 25th, 2023==
Yesterday at night I finally got a grade for my course work (I was waiting for it to be checked for a long time). After I have done some small corrections I got 5 (it is the highest grade), but I will still need to print my work and bring it to my school. I will do it tomorrow and it will take more than three hours to get there and back.

The teacher also checked all the learning practice assignments, but at that moment I didn't manage to do them all. I asked the teacher about that, she told that I could do some assignments until 11 am of the next day. 

For some reason I decided that It would be a good idea to sleep that night. I was sleeping for about 6 hours, but still did not manage to do all the tasks until 11 am. At about 12 am the internet connection disappeared. Right now I have 16 assignments done out of 18, however the teacher checked only 15 out of them. It is up for the teacher to give me either 4 or 5 points. I guess, that I will complete the rest of the work anyway.

The internet connection appeared at about 4:30 pm.
==December 26th, 2023==
Yesterday one teacher (the one who is responsible for the course work and the learning practice) told, that she would give us grades today at 11:30 am during our class. I had not done some assignments. I decided to sleep that night anyway. I was planning to sleep for 4.5 hours, but ended up with 6.

I have done every assignment, but the last one from the learning practice. The teacher was late and told that she would not check tasks for learning practice today because she didn't have time for that.  

She didn't know that I sent her a few more assignments that morning, but gave me the perfect score anyway. Of course, it is really frustrating, because I could save a lot of energy and time, but it is a good training for my mind. There is no reason for me to blame myself, at that moment, with the information and mindset that I had, it was a good decision, the only decision, that I could made. 

I wonder if I should do the last practice work for my learning practice. I guess, that I will do it anyway, just in case.

I was in Donetsk today. I brought my course work to my technical school and did some shopping for my mother. I got home late, at about 6 pm, I even was late on my Synergy online lesson. It happened because I left house only after the end of my online classes and I was waiting a lot for the bus on the way home.
==December 27th, 2023==
> [!note] Gratitude

I need to give myself more credit, go easier and be more grateful. I have heard this idea from different sources, including my teacher, LD. Obviously, I totally agree, but I was always good at finding reasons not to do this. From now on, I will do this kind of notes at least once a month. 

1) Travelling is always a hard ordeal for me. For the last few weeks I was doing it a lot and I was doing it with less stress and more confidence.
2) I did a good job at taking care of my grandmother and the house.
3) I helped my father quite a bit with this shift change.
4) I think, that I was able to handle stressful situations well.
5) The week without electricity and internet was quite a challenge, but I did my best to not waste that time.
6) I was able to extract a lot of lessons out of that week.
7) Even with all this commotion I didn't miss a single physical training (though, I had to delay some of them because of the trips)
8) I don't skip my English lessons (of course, the week without the electricity and internet became an exception. However, I do count our missing hours and I am planning to catch up on them).
9) I got better at cooking and cleaning while taking care of my granny.
10) I write daily notes almost without blanks.
11) I renewed my reading of Crime and Punishment.
12) The habit of doing morning posture exercises has chances to survive (I complete it in 7 days out of 10). It is not a good result, but it is better than nothing).

I decided to do a challenge for the people from Habitica and for LD. (It is complicated to explain, but you can create challenges for the party in that app).

**Challenge**:
Give yourself more credit, show your love and gratitude for this wonderful person! ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶

**What you should do:**
Create a list of things, that you should thank yourself for. Write down all the things that you have done well, list everything, that you should be proud about, all the moments, when you went an extra mile. 

Of course, don't write anything, that you don't feel comfortable sharing, but I still recommend you to create a full list for yourself.

**How to win?**

==December 28th, 2023==
Today I got another few final grades. I have solved almost all of my problems. At this point I only need to close one more subject, do one homework and a project for Synergy university and prepare for the Russian exam that will happen in the beginning of February.

I can not say, that I did a lot today, but this day brought me some good news. 



==December 29th, 2023==
Today I got my final grades for every subject. Right now I have almost no duties and learning assignments comparing to the situation on the beginning of this month. I did quite well. 

Even if I have a lot of free time right now, I still should not weaken my grip. This day was not productive because I spend too much time procrastinating. I was not even resting. It happened not only because I was blaming myself, but as well because I was not allowing myself to do the fun stuff, I though that I did not earn it. All I was doing for the whole day is watching videos that I was not even interested in (+ English lesson, training and some program setups).

I need to be more conscious with my choices. In the nearest few days I will came up with some new set of rules for myself and a plan for the next year.


==December 30th, 2023==
It is another type of note that I will try to do on a regular basis. I will try to find some moments, that are inspiring me. Not only it will help me not to forget about them, but as well to understand myself better.

My sources of inspiration:
1) I have been learning English for about 4 years now. Sometimes it seemed as if I was not making any progress. I knew that my level of English was not bad at all, but I often lacked confidence. In Novgorod the Great I met a native speaker and many students from linguistic universities. I had a lot of fun talking to these people. It really inspired me and gave me a lot of confidence in many things that I'm doing, especially in my English skills;
2) The championship in Novgorod was really hard, but I did quite well. Even with my pathetic level of knowledge at that topic I did not give up, I was able to learn many things in the process. It made me realise that I'm capable of doing so much more, that I though was possible;
3) Novgorod the Great is a really beautiful place, even with all the stress I was able to enjoy this trip. I believe that I was able to achieve the whole new level of meditation and understanding of things. Of course, I was able to do the same before and after Novgorod, but I was never able to do be in this kind of mindset for such a long time. I will work in this direction for sure;
4) During the week without electricity and internet I had to visit many people to do my homework. They were really kind to me and were able to love me unconditionally. It made me happy and reminded me, how much I love them. That week and those people opened a whole new level of understanding of importance of connections with people for me (I used way too much "of's" here).
5) Just the common stuff. Sometimes I have good days, days in which I manage to do a good job and find time for conscious leisure and rest. These days really make me feel refreshed. 
Of course, it is not a full list, but I will do this kind of notes every now and then.
