[[What is Julian playing at]] [[Julian]] [[The Secret History]] [[What was Julian's plan. How much did he know]]

Julian told, that he was not interested in his pupils, because he could see through them. 
As we know, it, mostly, was not true. He didn't know a lot about them, he was not able to find out about those events by himself, he needed a letter.

Maybe, he really knew them, but he knew only those parts of them that he himself created. Richard already told, that it was obvious, that he did not want to see other parts of them.

He was surprised by that letter? Was it a total surprise for him or he was (? grammar) surprised by Henry's reaction? Why didn't he find about it earlier, by himself? Why didn't he get more information out of Richard on that dinner? Was he afraid to hear the truth? Was he trying to close his eyes on this, deny that?

They run out of his control! He got afraid of that, he was not able to read them! Is it really true? Is it really the reason he run away? 

Is it possible, that, as Dionysus, he have already done his job, he spited them, let them free? [[What is Julian playing at]]
