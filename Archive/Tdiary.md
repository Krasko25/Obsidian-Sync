### January
==January 1st, 2024==
Recently I started learning about one topic, about ego. Usually we are told, that it is a bad thing. However, is it really possible for one to improve oneself without ego? 

Let's say that you want to win a school championship. For that you need to believe in yourself, believe, that you worth that. You also need to be ready to overstep a lot of people with the same ambitions. Isn't it arrogant to believe that you are better than all these people, to put your ambitions above others?

SOoou, as it seems to me, I have more accomplishments that an average person of my age, but I am not satisfied with myself, I think that I can and have to be much better. Isn't that greedy? Should I find a way to improve and rase to my standards or I should lower them (standards) and settle with what I'm now?

P.S: I know, that the right answer is to move forward and love myself for all my wins and loses at the same time, but it's kind of hard.
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, to do either of those things I need to change and to change I need to use the strong sides of my personality. In this note I will try to find them.

My trump cards (and how to improve them):
1) My values are going along with self-improvement.
- ability to accept everything as it is - sometimes I'm able to act according to this philosophy and it feels awesome, but for that I need to be more conscious with my actions and thoughts. Meditation is a great training for that.
- being open to a new experience - It is hard to train this, but I, once again, need to be more conscious so I don't miss those opportunities to widen my worldview.
- being honest - when it comes to self-improvement, the most important part is to be honest to yourself, keep your promises to yourself. That is the tricky part for me, It is easy for me to keep my promises to other people, but I constantly let myself down. I have read an article, that told, that your believe in yourself strongly depends on the fact of how often you lie to yourself. In other words, to trust and be confident in yourself, you need to keep your words to yourself.
- being mentally strong. It does sound silly, but this idea really inspires me.
2) It is easier for me to do things for other people. Is it because I'm kind? Or I care too much about others opinion? Or I need people's gratitude to feel good about myself? Or, maybe, I just was raised in this way? Anyway, I can abuse it in some way.
3) I have a lot of ambitions. Of course, it does not sound like a big advantage, but I met an awful lot of people of my age, who did not care about their future.
4) I'm flexible (I don't mean easily adaptive, of course, it is always takes me a lot of time to get used to new rules). What I mean is my ability and willingness to embrace new information and to alter my perception about the world and myself.
5) My achievements inspire me a lot. In the moments when I do well with something, it makes me want to keep going. The better I do, the more inspiration I get (though, maybe, it works like this for everyone ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

Maybe I have forgotten something, but I already want to go to bed.

==January 3rd, 2024==
For the last few days I was not awfully productive. It happened for many reasons, a big one of them is because I started watching a new anime (I'm not recording it in English). It was always hard for me to do small amount of things per a time. When it comes to entertainment contents I either consume nothing or an awful amount. I put some limitation rules for myself, let's see if they work.

I was delaying my year plans for a few days already. I will do my best to write about it tomorrow.
==January 4nd, 2024==
In this note I will try to sum up the results of this last year. I will use my old daily notes to do that.

First thing that I noticed is the inconsistency of my notes, in some months I was writing less than 1 note per a week. This aspect was improved greatly. The quality and length of notes has improved as well. I started writing more about my feelings and plans, make up some conclusions and takeaways from my experienсes. I consider this to be a really important improvement.

Let's talk about the way how I started each of those years. I totally can not name my start of this year to be successful, but it is way better than the start of the previous one. I have done more work. Each of the notes from the last year up to January 25th is full of regrets. I became not only more productive, but, more importantly, more positive.

In January of previous year I decided to meditate on a stable basis and progress in that. I still did not achieve the good results in this direction, especially when it comes to quality. This information is something between "really funny" and "depressing" to me. Obviously, I'm exaggerating my disappointment, but it is still not a good result. I need to work in that direction.

I read many notes from this year and was surprised, I was always writing about things that went wrong and almost never about WHY and HOW to change/avoid it (maybe, I was thinking about it, but was not expressing my thoughts in text form). I started to dig deeper only recently. I will do my best to keep moving in that direction.

Some of interesting things, that I have experienced during this year:
- my attempt to work on the project with Mikhail Georgievich and other people. We were trying to create a program for decision analysis. I made a program that used Saaty's method. However we were not able to get a grant for developing this project because of slow work with documentation from the side of university.
- Some adventures that I had to go through because I lost my phone.
- My trip to Novgorod the Great.
- The time that I spend taking care of my granny.
- The week without electricity and internet.

I'm grateful to this note, because of it I found out that I had made some progress not only with my studying, but also with my mindset.

Daily portion of gratitude: 
- I'm grateful to myself for the fact that I renewed my habit of reading books ("Crime and Punishment" doesn't count, because it is not stable),
- for my work on my new training system, that will be better for my health,
- for the fact, that I finally started my preparation for the math exam,
- for being a bit more conscious,
- for going to bed earlier, than usually.

==January 5th, 2024==
Almost all my life I had some portion of sport in my life. I was playing football, cycling, participating in some school sport activities, doing some stupid sport challenges, etc. However, I gain consistency with my individual trainings only two years ago. 

After these two years I got a normal level of physical shape and a good amount of knowledge about training. My training sessions are consistent and I'm trying to give it all up in each set. Though, Iately, It seems to me that I make no progress. I am not gaining weight, my strength is not increasing and it is hard to track the grow of my muscles. 

I believe that there are three main factors:
- I don't eat enough. Recently I started tracking my calories and it is hard for me to hit my daily norm.
- I can not choose the direction in which I want to move, I'm trying to gain muscle size, calisthenics strength (ability to move your body in space (pull ups, dips, etc)), weighted calisthenics strength, flexibility, endurance and learn a few hard technical exercises.
- I was told, that I should not lift heavy weights because of my spine problems, it is bad for my health. Because of this limitation it is hard to work on my muscle size, especially when it comes to legs.

I decided to make up my mind and shift my focus on something more narrow. I decided to work to achieve the calisthenics type of strength and flexibility. It will not only be beneficial for my health, but will also allow me to track my progress easily. I will be able to do that thanks to different progressions in hard exercises. 

A bit of gratitude: I think that I can safely say now that I'm doing my trainings before the lunch, just as I planned, it is also good that I had a lesson with LD today and that I continue to analyse my experiences in different arias.
==January 6th, 2024==
This day was not successful. I don't know how to balance between work and leisure time. It seems to me that once I start doing some kind of entertainment, It is hard for me to get out of it. Once I start, I keep making weak decisions. It is as if I can either be really productive or do nothing useful at all (of course, I am being a bit too dramatic here, I do something, but that is not enough).

For the last few days I was reading one book about training with my bodyweight. It inspires me a lot. Though I don't have trainings neither today or tomorrow, so I am trying not to overdo it and let my body rest a bit.

Tomorrow I will write my plans for this year.

Some gratitude:
- I inspired LD (my English teacher) to work on herself more, physically and mentally, it is good.
- I am grateful to myself, because I keep reading books;
- I'm consistent with my trainings, it is good. I also don't forget about the rest for my body, it is really important.

==January 7th, 2024==
My plans for this year. 
___
This year is going to be quite troublesome and unpredictable for me. I will graduate from my technical school this year and will have to deal with military service. Most likely, I will go to some university to delay my military service (I want to win some time, because there is a war in our country right now).

At this point, I'm not sure, where I should go, I didn't even choose the town. I can learn in the same place where I live right now, but universities here are not considered to be good. Learning at my grandma's place is an another option, but I will have to spend at very least 4 hours to get from home to university and back. There are 2 more options.

Here are some of my plans about studying for this year:
1) To finish reading Crime and Punishment until February 7th.
2) To pass successfully my exam on February 7th.
3) I want to save my habit of reading everyday.
4) To start working on my diploma project before the end of January.
5) To finish my diploma and all the other stuff. This time I will aim to do all of my learning work ON time (not IN time).
6) To find a company for my industrial practice, successfully finish working there with a new experience and whatnot.
7) To finish my studying in my technical school.
8) To finish my online course in Synergy university.
9) To pass successfully my math, Russian and computer science exams.
10) All the other stuff is quite unpredictable, so I will try to concentrate on something, that I have more control over. 

Of course, the most control I have over my own mind (or, at least, I should). I think that this is actually going to be my main priority. I do so many weak decision and it is really hard to feel good about myself sometimes. I want not only to become more disciplined, conscious, but also to love myself more, be able to understand myself, my feelings, the reasons of my actions and emotions.

Also I want to put more emphasis on my trainings. I'm not sure how much progress I have made in the last year, because I was shifting my priorities all the time. It is not good. I will try to do better job this time to understand my progress and my body better. Here are some of my goals:
1) 10 (at very least 5) one arm push ups with a good form on each arm. Right now I can do 1-2 reps with bearable form.
2) 3 (at least 1) one armed pull ups on each arm. 
3) 50 pistol squats on each leg. Right now I can do about 25 reps on each leg
4) 5 dragon pistol squats on each leg. At the moment I can do 0-2 reps.
5) 20 (at least 10) handstand push ups without a wall. Right now I can do 7 reps with a wall.
6) work on my core muscles and grip strength. 

Those training goals can look a bit ambitious, but I think, that I will be able to achieve them.

**Gratitude time**: 
- this note in not bad, it can be quite useful in the future,
- good work with reading,
- for the last few days I finally use my obsidian setup. All those notes can be useful not only in the future, but it also helps to understand information better.

==January 8th, 2024==
Today was not a greatly productive day, but this time I have an excuse. The real winter finally started in our country and I had to spend a lot of time and efforts to clean off the snow out of our house territory. I had to do it twice, because the snow was not stopping. It seems, that I also caught a cold.

Today I got the information about my next learning semester. It will start at January 12th.

Right now I have to choose between trying to do some progress with the Synergy project or going to sleep. I guess, that I need to build some kind of sleeping pattern, that is more important right now.

Gratitude punch:
1) I keep reading books, it's good;
2) I think that the quality of my meditations has improved a bit;
3) I continue my preparation for the exam on February 7th;
4) I train according to my new training program, it is going good for now.

==January 9th, 2024==
I continue to train according to my new program. Though I have to change it every once in a while. It happens because I use a few sources of information to build my training program and I'm yet to finish reading one book, that I use as a main source of information (maybe, I should have changed my workouts after finishing my system, but I was way to excited to wait).

Today I got some information about the upcoming call in Habitica, I'm looking forward to it.

Gratitude splash:
1) I don't betray my new habits and keep taking care of them daily.
2) I currently working on the quality of my reps during training. I slow down to learn to feel the work on my muscles and avoid traumas. All this is lowering the amount of reps and it hurts my ego so I want to praise myself for doing it.
3) I manage to complete my list of calories each day for a few days in a row.

==January 10th, 2024==
For the last few days my sleeping schedule was a mess. I fall asleep at about 2 am and wake up at about 11 or 12 am. Not only it takes me more time to sleep, but it also violates my level of energy. 

I also did no progress in my learning project. I don't have to do it. It gives me only 5 points out of a 100, but I want to do it anyway. I think that is will help me to understand the topic better. Not to mention, I already promised myself to do it, so it will hurt my ego to give up on this.

Today I finally did some progress on the project, I hope to finish it tomorrow. Though, I had to give up on reading and math today. Of course, I could do a bit of it today, but in this case I would have to fall asleep at about 11:45 pm, which is not good enough.

A gratitude dive:
1) I'm grateful to myself for putting my sleep above other things.
2) Being able not to be angry with myself for missing my dailies is also a good thing.
3) I do routines to fix my scoliosis every day (though, I do it in different time because of my inconsistent sleep).

==January 11th, 2024==
Today I was able to wake up way earlier than I usually do. I did all my dailies and had a lesson with my English teacher (actually I have one almost every day, but usually don't write about it). Though, I was not able to finish the project, that I was talking about, because I spend quite some time playing with friends. 

Tomorrow my online classes are starting. It will be hard to combine my new habits and preparation for exams together with doing homework for my school, but I'll do my best.

A gesture of gratitude:
- I am grateful to myself for being able to spare some time to spend with my friends.
- I did a good job reading today. I flew into the process and was reading for 70 minutes, which is more than usual.
- I will fall asleep at relatively early time.

==January 12th, 2024==
It snowed today. I was finishing a cleaning process at the moment when my mother got home from work. 







==January 13th, 2024==
Today our Habitica party had a call. We got to talk to each other, that, in my opinion, will help us to be more motivated not to let each other down. Not only that, I finally got to talk to like minded people in English and it was really interesting. I'm learning this language for about 4 years now and I like English a lot. It can sound silly, but it feels kind of lonely not to be able to talk to almost anyone on it. 

I decided that my main goal for this week is to build my sleeping schedule. Today I'm going to bed only 1.5 hours later, that I had to. Not matter how funny it sound, but it is already some kind of a progress.

P.S: yes, I'm not talking about everything else today, because there is almost nothing good to talk about, I wasted the whole day.

GRrrratitude time:
- I keep doing exercises for my scoliosis every day;
- I am falling asleep today (not tomorrow);
- I spare some time to play with my friends.

==January 14th, 2024==
This day was a bit more productive. I was reading Crime and Punishment, having my English lesson, did some preparation for my math exam. Though I did not manage to fall asleep on time. 

Some praise:
- I did a good job reading Crime and Punishment and breaking down it's chapters;
- I manage to eat full set of calories for the last few days;
- I play with my dog every day, even if it is really cold outside.

==January 15th, 2024==
- [ ] Today was the second day of a new semester of my college learning. Today we had 5 lessons planed, but only 3 teachers decided to do their classes. I had a hard time listening to teacher during the first lesson, because of my sleeping schedule. The English lesson today was interesting, we were talking a lot about computer science stuff and also we assured the teacher to watch one anime.

The part with gratitude to myself:
- I think, that I will be able to fall asleep earlier today.
- I helped my parents by cleaning snow on our territory.
- I wasted less time than yesterday (if we will not count a few hour of extra sleep).

==January 16, 2024==
Today I finally woke up relatively early (3 hours earlier than usual, but 2 hours later than according to my plan). I feel like this day was more successful, than the precious ones.

After lessons in my college I had a workout and spent more time with my dog than usual. I made some progress reading the book, that I need to finish for my exam and did some homework.

 Though I was not able to send it to teachers, because the electricity was turned off in the evening. I hope that we will get it back soon. On the bright side, thanks to the absence of electricity, today I will finally fall asleep on time.

Today I also got a phone call about the exams. I will need to solve some problems with documents this week.

Time to praise myself:
1) I'm happy, that I am able to be positive even when talking about hardships.
2) I continue to find creative ways to challenge myself during workouts.
3) I will finally fall asleep on time. 

==January 17th, 2024== This note was written on January 20th

I still had no electricity. Also I got a phone call about my exams yesterday, I had to appear at one place to sign some documents. I also had some online lectures today. Obviously I would not be able to be present on them because I had no electricity. I came up with this plan: go to the place where I needed to sign documents and use mobile network to participate on the main online class there (there is no mobile network in my village).

This time I got the the bus stop without running!!! Though I was originally planning to take a previous bus... Anyway, it's still counts! 

There were some unexpected events, so I had to participate in that online class while being on the street. That teacher allowed people not to write a summary of a lecture if the one was answering during an online class (I must have made a few grammar mistakes here so feel free to correct me). However, the teacher did not allow me to do this, because I already have got a few grades like this. I was trying to persist. The teacher asked me about my reasons. I said, that I would have to write a lecture if I don't get a grade. She laughed and said that it would not kill me to write a lecture once in a while.

After that I signed those documents. There were two options: easier exam and harder one. I have chosen the harder variation, because it will give me more options for learning in the future. I got to choose the subjects, that I wanted to be examined for. Other than the subjects, that I needed to get to the university on my profession, I choose the written and oral English exams. I don't have to participate in them, I did it just for fun. I think, that I have some good chance to pass them successfully. 

After I got home I helped my father with one business. We still had no electricity, so he decided to use the electricity generator, that was bought many years before, but was not used. Though it was placed far from our home, so we had to use a car. The generator weighted more than 50 kg, so it was quite hard to deliver it, we spend more than an hour to do that. Obviously, as soon as we brought the generator (how else could this be), the electricity from government was turned on.

I don't recall the other part of this day, because I'm writing it on January 20th.
==January 18th, 2024==
Today I finally started my day exactly how I wanted. I woke up at 5:30 am, did a quick stretching, did some morning duties outside of the house, did my scoliosis routine, had a meditation and a breakfast. I had my entire morning routine finished at 6:45 am. It feels awesome.

After the successful morning I did some good job with my homework and reading the book for my exam. I was even doing stretches between learning process. It was about 10 am and I had a lot of job done, so I decided to take a little break and... ... I wasted almost the entire day. The only useful things, that I have done during the rest of the day are taking an English lesson, training and providing some help to my parents.

It seems that there is a clear pattern.
1) When I wake up early the chances of having a "good day" are higher (it was obvious, but still);
2) First hours of the day is a groundwork for the whole day (once again, it is a common knowledge, but, for some reason, I ignore it all the time);
3) I am way too sensitive to my weak decisions. When I allow myself to take an easy path, brake some discipline a bit, my whole system of control breaks into pieces. With each "weak" decision, it is easier to do the next one.

Just to clarify: I see nothing wrong about having some leisure time, but there should be some principles. 

For example, I decided to take a 20 minute break to watch some anime. It is fine, it was a conscious decision. The problem starts when I spend 30 minutes instead of 20. Those 10 minutes of extra time are not a problem. The weak decision is the problem. I told that I will stop after 20 minutes, but did not. I broke my promise to myself. It leads to a few implications: It damages my believe to myself, causes a feel of regret and undermines my respect to my rules (they can be broken).

Honesty is one of the most important values for me and still I constantly lie to myself, I got tired of this. 

For now my plan is simple, I will create some precise rules. I will have a right to change the rules for the next day if it is needed, but I will have to finish the day under given rules, no matter what.

Tomorrow I will use a timer to measure my work periods. After each work session I will have an opportunity to choose the amount of time for leisure. It is impossible to extend a break time in that app, you can choose the duration only one time after your work session. I will have to pay for this leisure time with my Habitica coins according to my rates. I will also have a right to spend as much time as I want (for free) on stretching and other activities without electronic devices.

I know, that those rules are way too easy to follow, but I think that it would be better to follow easy rules than breaking the hard ones.
==January 19th, 2024==
Today I woke up quite late. I did my morning routine, cooked one dish to take some problems out of my mother's plate and had a training. After that I was expecting my friends to visit me. They did, but, unexpectedly, my sister, her husband and my nephew came at the came time as my friends did. Spending time with my family and friends took quite a lot of time, so I was able to only do the Habitica call, English lesson and write this note. I aim for a long term development, so I will prioritise my sleep.

By the way, my nephew is going to spend a night at our place.

During the Habitica call I choose the same goals as I had during the previous week. I did that because I just didn't feel like I have achieved them. Though I think that It would be better to choose something, the progress in which is easier to measure.

During the upcoming week I want to:
1) Have at least 5 days, when I fall asleep and wake up on time.
2) I am currently learning at one online course to prepare for my math exam. Currently I have 20% of progress. I want to have 30-40% of progress by the end of this week.
3) I want to read at least part number 5 of the book "Crime and Punishment" (5 chapters).

A pinch of gratitude:
- It is good that I put my sleep above other things.
- Technically speaking, I did not break any of the rules, that I have created for myself yesterday.
- I'm glad that I got to spend some time with my family and friend.
- My trainings are consistent.
- The Habitica call was interesting, I am happy, that I'm a part of this party.

==January 20th, 2024==
Today I spend quite a lot of time helping my parents and playing with my nephew. Today my father wanted to setup the electricity generator, that we brought home on January 17th. I was helping him. He believed that it would take almost no time. Just as expected, It took more hours than we expected it to take. Even after all this time, it did not start to work.

All those activities took quite a lot of time, but I managed to do an ok amount of work. I finally did some progress with my math preparation, was reading a book (not the one for exam), had a training, an English lesson, a bit of homework and felt asleep in time. I did a bit of everything, but I still consider it to be a progress.

I also spend some time training with my nephew. He is 10. Each time he spends some time at my place I'm doing that and each time he looses all the progress and form and we start from the scratch. I know that he is 10, but it is still frustrating. I hope that I'm not being too strict with him.

Gratitude moment:
1) I'm grateful for myself for helping my parents;
2) for being patient;
3) for taking care of my nephew;
4) for respecting the rules, that I set for myself beforehand;
5) for going to bed early.

==January 21st, 2024==
Today I woke up at 7:20 (which is almost early from my measurements). Usually it would be a hallmark of a good day, but it was not the case today. 

In the morning I allowed myself to break the rules a bit and watch some silly videos on youtube. My youtube is set the way, that it gets throws me away after 5 minutes of use. Even with that, I was opening it over and over again. The worst part about this kind of situations is that you don't rest or enjoy it, it just drains your energy away.

Throughout the day I had that temptation go back there to that circle of self-destruction again. In some way, I can say that by all those actions I was growing up my habit of disrespecting rules (I violate them many times before! Nothing outrageous happened! It is a normal thing to do). We are forming a habit of missing good habits when we act like this. Someone from our party was bringing up this idea before, but I don't recall who exactly did that.

During the day I was teaching my nephew English, it seems, that he got some progress out of it. At about 4 pm my nephew went back home.

During the last few days I had a lot of friends and spend a lot of time being lazy. Because of this, today I had to work of my project for Synergy university at night. I finished it. I don't even know what to say, it took only about 4-6 hours to finish this project, but I was postponing it for a few weeks, that's just lame and shameful. 

Switching to something positive, gratitude:
1) I finally finished my project. The mare fact of this debt was draining energy out of me, I'm happy, that I solved this problem.
2) I continue preparing for my math exam.
3) My English lessons are consistent.

==January 22nd, 2024==
This day was quite average, I managed to do a few useful things, but I also violated my rules a few times today (I set those rules in the daily note for January 18th). My problem is that in the moment of hesitation I'm way too good when it comes to finding excuses for small rule breakers. I think that the key is to stop taking those allowances as something trivial (sure, it is an easy on the paper, but when you are in the moment, it is quite an ordeal, at least for me)

Positive highlights:
1) I finally completed all the three main goals for the day (math, Crime and Punishment and sleep). For some reason I was missing one or two pieces on each day.
2) I had a good workout today.
3) I was helping my parents today.
4) I analize my mistakes, it is good.

==January 23rd, 2024==
Today I did a bit of progress and a bit of rule breakers, nothing to be strongly frustrated or proud about. 

At the moment, I don't have many hard things, that I have to do right now. The homework from college is mostly about writing summaries of lectures, I have a break time at the course of Synergy university and preparation for the exam on February 7th goes smoothly. 

However, I find the type of this situation to be the most dangerous. Even when I don't have some strict deadlines in the nearest time, the wave of a hellish amount of work is going to cover me in just a few month: learning practices, searching the compony for the production practice and working there, new module of Synergy university course, my diploma, the exams from my college and another 3 exams in May (the ones, that I need to go through, because of the shift of the education system in our country). Oh... I almost forgot, after that I will have to find a job and/or chose and get to university, move from my home and deal with a military office.

Basically, at one hand I have no strict deadlines right now, what causes becomes a dangerous temptation to relax, and the stress from the upcoming ordeals, that I will have to undertake (to undertake the/an ordeal - a flex way of saying, that you have completed a really hard work).

Anyway, at a (O ^ n) time I will say, that I have to prioritise my sleep and be more disciplined. 

P.S: (O ^ n) equals approximately to "way too much to count".

It's time to scrape together some reason to be proud about myself:
1) I write my daily notes every day (except January 12th, but I'll fix it later);
2) it seems, that I don't blame myself as much as I did before;
3) I wrote down some of my worries, I think, that it will help me to understand myself better;
4) My sleeping schedule got a git better.
