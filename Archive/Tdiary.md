### January
==January 1st, 2023==
Recently I started learning about one topic, about ego. Usually we are told, that it is a bad thing. However, is it really possible for one to improve oneself without ego? 

Let's say that you want to win a school championship. For that you need to believe in yourself, believe, that you worth that. You also need to be ready to overstep a lot of people with the same ambitions. Isn't it arrogant to believe that you are better than all these people, to put your ambitions above others?

SOoou, as it seems to me, I have more accomplishments that an average person of my age, but I am not satisfied with myself, I think that I can and have to be much better. Isn't that greedy? Should I find a way to improve and rase to my standards or I should lower them (standards) and settle with what I'm now?

P.S: I know, that the right answer is to move forward and love myself for all my wins and loses at the same time, but it's kind of hard.
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, to do either of those things I need to change and to change I need to use the strong sides of my personality. In this note I will try to find them.

My trump cards (and how to improve them):
1) My values are going along with self-improvement.
- ability to accept everything as it is - sometimes I'm able to act according to this philosophy and it feels awesome, but for that I need to be more conscious with my actions and thoughts. Meditation is a great training for that.
- being open to a new experience - It is hard to train this, but I, once again, need to be more conscious so I don't miss those opportunities to widen my worldview.
- being honest - when it comes to self-improvement, the most important part is to be honest to yourself, keep your promises to yourself. That is the tricky part for me, It is easy for me to keep my promises to other people, but I constantly let myself down. I have read an article, that told, that your believe in yourself strongly depends on the fact of how often you lie to yourself. In other words, to trust and be confident in yourself, you need to keep your words to yourself.
- being mentally strong. It does sound silly, but this idea really inspires me.
2) It is easier for me to do things for other people. Is it because I'm kind? Or I care too much about others opinion? Or I need people's gratitude to feel good about myself? Or, maybe, I just was raised in this way? Anyway, I can abuse it in some way.
3) I have a lot of ambitions. Of course, it does not sound like a big advantage, but I met an awful lot of people of my age, who did not care about their future.
4) I'm flexible (I don't mean easily adaptive, of course, it is always takes me a lot of time to get used to new rules). What I mean is my ability and willingness to embrace new information and to alter my perception about the world and myself.
5) My achievements inspire me a lot. In the moments when I do well with something, it makes me want to keep going. The better I do, the more inspiration I get (though, maybe, it works like this for everyone ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

Maybe I have forgotten something, but I already want to go to bed.

==January 3rd, 2023==
For the last few days I was not awfully productive. It happened for many reason, of them is because I started watching a new anime (I'm not recording it in English). It was always hard for me to do small amount of things per a time. When it comes to entertainment contents I either consume nothing or an awful amount. I put some limitation rules for myself, let's see if it works.

I was delaying my year plans for a few days already. I will do my best to write about it tomorrow.
==January 4nd, 2023==
In this note I will try to sum up the results of the last year. I will use my old daily notes to do that.

First thing that I noticed is the inconsistency of my notes, in some months I was writing less than 1 note per a week. This aspect was improved greatly. The quality and length of notes has improved as well. I started writing more about my feelings and plans, make up some conclusions and takeaways from my experienсes. I consider this to be a really important improvement.

Let's talk about the way how I started each of those years. I totally can not name my start of this year to be successful, but it is way better than the start of one. I have done more work. Each of the notes from the last year up to January 25th is full of regrets. I became not only more productive, but, more importantly, also more positive.

At January of previous year I decided to meditate on a stable basis and progress in that. I still did not achieve the good results in this direction, especially when it comes to quality. This information is something between "really funny" and "depressing" to me. Obviously, I'm exaggerating my disappointment, but it is still not a good result. I need to work in that direction.

I read many note from this year and was surprised, I was always writing about things that went wrong and almost never about why and how to change/avoid it (maybe, I was thinking about it, but was not expressing my thoughts in text). I started to dig deeper only recently. I will do my best to keep moving in that direction.

Some of interesting things, that I have experienced during this year:
- my attempt to work on the project with Mikhail Georgievich and other people. We were trying to create a program for decision analysis. I made a program with Saaty method. However, we were not able to get a grant for developing this project because of slow work with documentation from the side of university.
- Some adventures that I had to go through because I lost my phone.
- My trip to Novgorod the Great.
- The time that I spend taking care of my granny.
- The week without electricity and internet.

I'm grateful to this note, because of it I found out that I have made some progress not only with my studying, but also with my mindset.

Daily portion of gratitude: 
- I'm grateful to myself for the fact that I renewed my habit of reading books ("Crime and Punishment" doesn't count, because it is not stable),
- for my work on my new training system, that will be better for my health,
- for the fact, that I finally started my preparation for the math exam,
- for being a bit more conscious,
- for going to bed earlier, than usually.

Almost all my life I had some portion of sport in my life. I was playing football, cycling, participating in some school sport activities, doing some stupid sport challenges, etc. However, I gain consistency with my individual trainings only two years ago. 

After these two years I got a normal level of physical shape and a good amount of knowledge about training. My training sessions are consistent and I'm trying to give it all up in each set. Though, Iately, It seems to me that I make no progress. I am not gaining weight, my strength is not increasing and it is hard to track the grow of my muscles. 

I believe that there are three main factors:
- I don't eat enough. Recently I started tracking my calories and it is hard for me to hit my daily norm.
- I can not choose the direction in which I want to move, I'm trying to gain muscle size, calisthenics strength (ability to move your body in space (pull ups, dips, etc)), weighted calisthenics strength, flexibility, endurance and learn a few hard technical exercises.
- I was told, that I should not lift heavy weights because of my spine problems, it is bad for my health. Because of this limitation it is hard to work on my muscle size, especially when it comes to legs.

I decided to make up my mind and shift my focus on something more narrow. I decided to work to achieve the calisthenics type of strength and flexibility. It will not only be beneficial for my health, but will also allow me to track my progress easily. I will be able to do that thanks to different progressions in hard exercises. 

A bit of gratitude: I think that I can safely say now that I'm doing my trainings before the lunch, just as I planned, it is also good that I had a lesson with LD today and that I continue to analyse my experiences in different arias.
==January 6th, 2023==
This day was not successful. I don't know how to balance between work and leisure time. It seems to me that once I start doing some kind of entertainment, It is hard for me to get out of it. Once I start, I keep making weak decisions. It is as if I can either be really productive or do nothing useful at all (of course, I am being a bit too dramatic here, I do something, but that is not enough).

For the last few days I was reading one book about training with my bodyweight. It inspires me a lot. Though, I don't have trainings neither today or tomorrow, so I am trying not to overdo it and let my body rest a bit.

Tomorrow I will write my plans for this year.

Some gratitude:
- I inspired LD (my English teacher) to work on herself more, physically and mentally, it is good.
- I am grateful to myself for keep reading books;
- I'm consistent with my trainings, it is good. I also don't forget about the rest for my body, it is really important.

My plans for this year. 
___
This year is going to be quite troublesome and unpredictable for me. I will graduate from my technical school this year and will have to deal with military service. Most likely, I will go to some university to delay my military service (I want to win some time, because there is a war in our country right now).

At this point, I'm not sure, where I should go, I don't even choose the town. I can learn in the same place where I live right now, but universities here are not considered to be good. Learning at my grandma's place is an another option, but I will have to spend at very least 4 hours to get from home to university. There are 2 more options.

Here are some of my plans about studying for this year:
1) Finish reading Crime and Punishment until February 7th.
2) Successfully pass my exam on February 7th.
3) I want to save my habit of reading everyday.
4) Start working on my diploma project before the end of January.
5) Finish my diploma and all the other stuff. This time I will aim to do all of this ON time (not IN time).
6) Find a company for my industrial practice, successfully finish working there with a new experience and whatnot.
7) Finish my studying in my technical school.
8) Finish my online course in Synergy university.
9) Successfully pass my math, Russian and computer science exams.
10) All the other stuff is quite unpredictable, so I will try to concentrate on something, that I have more control over. 

Of course, the most control I have over my own mind (or, at least, I should). I think that this is actually going to be my main priority. I do so many weak decision and it is really hard to feel good about myself sometimes. I want not only to become more disciplined, conscious, but also to love myself more, be able to understand myself, my feelings, the reasons of my actions and emotions.

Also I want to put more emphasis to my trainings. I'm not sure how much progress I have mare in the last year, because I was shifting my priorities all the time. It is not good. I will try to do better job this time to understand my progress and my body better. Here are some of my goals:
1) 10 (at very least 5) one arm push ups with a good form on each arm. Right now I can do 1-2 reps with bearable form.
2) 3 (at least 1) one armed pull ups on each arm. 
3) 50 pistol squats on each leg. Right now I can do about 25 reps on each leg
4) 5 dragon pistol squats on each leg. At the moment I can do 0-2 reps.
5) 20 (at least 10) handstand push ups without a wall. Right now I can do 7 reps with a wall.
6) work on my core muscles and grip strength. 

This training goal can look a bit ambitious, but I think, that I will be able to achieve them.

**Gratitude time**: 
- this note in not bad, it can be quite useful in the future,
- good work with reading,
- for the last few days I finally use my obsidian setup. All this notes can be useful not only in the future, but it also helps to understand information better.
