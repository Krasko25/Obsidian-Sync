Диктант
	Just for the record I do not consider myself an evil person (though how like a killer that makes me sound!). But while I have never considered myself a very good person, neither can  bring myself to believe that I'm spectacularly bad one. Perhaps it's simply impossible to think of oneself in such a case in point. What we did, but still I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chock it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry's, too much Greek prose composition - whatever you like... I suppose I should have had a better idea of what I was letting myself in for.

Make a gratitude to myself from a perspective of a dog (or any other being) #Mark/Idea
