Диктант
	Take Henry, for instance. If Hampden hadn't let him in, he probably wouldn't be able to go to college at all... It does sound absurd, but he never went past tenth grade in high school and, I mean, how many dissent colleges are likely to take a tenth-grade drop-out SATs. He's got some kind of aesthetic problem with test.
