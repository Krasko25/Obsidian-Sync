[[Vagabond. Бродяга]] [[Inshun]]

He is way to remoted from other people and monks. He does not feel other people, he lacks empathy and has no fear. He does not understand fear. Because of that, people don't understand him, they are scared of him. He can not teach those, who he can't understand. 

All his power stems from his technical skills and the lack of fear.

> His studied technique in magnificent, but his heart, his soul, he focuses too much of his "self".
