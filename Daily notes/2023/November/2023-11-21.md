###### The Secret History
Henry does not talk about that time when he broke a few bones to one guy in a bar. Judy Poowey. He believes it to be common.

###### Диктант
Spike comes up and see them abusing me, and he shoves the twin on the shoulder... Two of them had jumped on him. Six guys couldn't pull Henry off. He broke spikes collarbone and two ribs. I told spike he should have called the cops, but he was in some kind of trouble himself and wasn't supposed to be on campus. He'd be able to beat them out of both those sissy guys in suits and ties and stuff.
I guess when uptight people like that get mad, they get really mad. Like my father.
