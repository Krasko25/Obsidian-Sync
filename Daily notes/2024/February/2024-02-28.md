How quickly he fell; how soon it was over. It is also discouraging, because I recognise attempts at analysis are largely useless. I don't know, why we did it. I'm not entirely sure that, that circumstances demanding, we wouldn't do it again. And if I'm sorry, it a way, that probably doesn't make much difference.
