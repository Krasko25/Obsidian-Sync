##### Temple [[vagabond]]
[[Gion]] [[Musashi]] I noticed that Gion could be a double (двойник) of Musashi. I believe, that Gion can help us to understand the character of Musashi.

Gion himself told, that they were alike, "You are just like me, you only know how to speak through your sword". Gion fights just for the fun of it, it is good enough reason for him to risk his life. 

Mushashi finds Gion's stance to be loose, but at the same time he has some kind of a stile, it's as if Gion is Musashi with more polish.

##### [[Yagyu]]'s place
After Gion saw the fight between Inshun and Musashi, he run away. Just as Musashi, he was broken by fear. He came to Yagyu to meet his death, he had no other meaning in his life other than fighting. 

I suppose, that Gion is a Musashi, that was not lucky enough to face Takuan and The Great In'ei. chapter 66.

By the way, Gion wanted to attack Yagyu from the ambush. Musashi wanted to attack Inshun at night in the same manner. Gion attacked him, when Yagyu didn't even have a sword. Both of them were not trying to win a fair fight, they were trying to just get over it. 

##### No man is an island by himself
When Gion got scared and was too ashamed to continue living and too weak to deal with his emotion, he decided to die. He didn't go to his master, to his school, he was to ashamed to ask for help, he wanted to be independent, be complete by himself. It is really similar to the idea of being invincible of Musashi.
