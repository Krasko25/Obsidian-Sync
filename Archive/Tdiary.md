### February 2024

==February 1st, 2024==

I can not call this day to be successful, but there were a few good moments. For example, I finally write one of the essays that I was owning to my English teacher. I promised to write another one tomorrow. 

Anyway, today I will write my gratitude for everything that I have done during January 2024.
- I want to thank Mikhail for all the efforts during this month.
- I think that I was able to be more grateful to Mikhail during this month, I'm grateful for that.
- There was made some efforts to prepare for my exam on February 7th, such as making up essays and reading Crime and Punishment.
- I am grateful to Mikhail for being able to deal with stress better than usual.
- Mikhail did quite a few adjustments to his training program, nice job.
- Mikhail decided to made his health his highest priority while creating a new training program. Some of the new exercises could not be as effective from the perspective of muscle volume, but he overpowered his ego anyway. Thanks for that.
- Mikhail is trying to regulate his sleeping schedule, it is really important.
- Mikhail has already start his preparation for a math exam. Of course, he spends not much time on it, but it is still some progress.
- Awesome Habit Party started doing Habitica calls and other things for accountability. Of course it is not directly result of his actions, but he is still grateful for everything and everyone involved (including himself).
- Thanks to Mikhail for writing notes every day. Though, I think, that he should try to keep it shorter in the future.
- Maybe Mikhail forgot something, but, anyway, I'm grateful to him for not being troubled about that.

==February 2nd, 2024==
Today was not a successful day, but there were a few highlights. Let's talk about them in gratitude form:
- I wrote another essay for the upcoming exam (though I finished it quite late), just as I promised. This one seems to be not bad at the moment.
- I have this bad habit of mine, I postpone (delay) the completion of my physical education homework to the last day before a deadline. It happens because I really don't like doing this subject. The thing is that our PE teacher is quite strict and gives a bald amount of homework. And the worth part that this PE homework has nothing to do with physical activity! It's just a paper work! Spending 60 or 90 minutes to do a homework for physical education, on the subject that is supposed to be easy and funny... it's fells just... unfair. I know that my own expectation is the problem here, but still. Aaanyyway, all this looong explanation was necessary for the context of gratitude, sorry for that. Today I was supposed to do my homework for PE, that I was delaying to the end of the week, but this time was different. Just imagine how happy I was when I found out that I have already done this homework on Monday!! Sure, it's a small thing, but for some reason it inspired me a lot. Because of such small Ws (W - win) I find myself wanting do everything on time.
- Just as I do every day, I spend some time with my dog. Usually I tend to forget it, but it's such a lovely creature. I grateful for noticing it again.

My plans for February:
- start doing my diploma until February 10th;
- build a stable sleeping schedule (10 pm - 6 am);
- successfully pass my exam of February 7th;
- start preparing for my Russian exam in May (or June, I'm not totally sure when it happens).
- finish my math course and start the next one.
- be proud of myself.
- I want to follow the rules, that I will list below.

Here are my new set of rules about leisure time:
1. Rest without electronic devises is unlimited (I don't think that I will lose much time on that).
2. Stretching in the leisure time is HIGHLY commended.
3. Small pauses to stretch, go to toilet or to drink water can be done in any time (even in the middle of pomodoro).
4. Here are my daily allowance:
- Youtube - 2 sets of 15 minutes (I will not forbid watching shorts, but I don't think, that I would want to spend this time like this)
- "Useful" videos of Youtube. By that I mean videos, that are supposed to be useful, but, in most cases, they contain very little of useful information ("Why do you need to count calories", "The problem with active recall technique", etc). 2 sets of 15 minutes.
- Entertainment content, that I need to breakdown in English after consuming - 60 minutes, that can be divided to parts equal to 15 of 30 minutes (time, that I spend to do voice recordings do not count). P.S: there are a few anime and mangas that we studying with my English teacher.
- Entertainment context - 2 sets of 30 minutes and 3 sets of 10 minutes
5. Rules for using the allowance:
- I'm allowed to use any media for unlimited time if it's necessary for studying (for example, a youtube video about solving some problem in a code)
- I can use a set of allowance only after some work done (pomodoro, training or English).
- I can use only 1 set after one piece of work.
- I can NOT change to duration or type of allowance piece after starting the timer.
- If I have some allowance in the end of the day, I can save it for tomorrow, however (!), I can save only one set.
6. Limitations from above was no power when I spend time with friends

The reason why I stopped using coins from Habitica because my earnings are way too inconsistent. I also wanted to have a system, that would engage me to consume an entertainment content, that I will have to breakdown in English. However, I still want to use Habitica coins to motivate me in some way. It would be a great pleasure for me if someone recommends me a way to do that.

P.S. (for LD): Habitica is a program for tracking your habits and tasks. The feature of this app is that it is similar to a game. When you complete your tasks or habits, you get coins, experience (to lvl up your character) and different stuff. You can use coins to buy rewards for yourself (for example, 15 minutes of watching youtube can worth 30 coins).
==February 3rd, 2024==
Today I was acting according to the rules, that I stated yesterday. I think that. was doing good, however, I was not able to do a great amount of things because I woke up at 8:10 am and there was a birthday party of my brother. 

The Habitica call today was quite interesting. For the first time we were using web cameras. I decided that making an estimated road map for my Diploma and passing my exam on Wednesday are going to my my main goals for the week.

I think that we also forgot to talk about cleaning during the Habitica call (or, maybe, people were talking it after I left). I completed my cleaning goal only half way, but I will fix it and send photos tomorrow.

Some gratitude to Mikhail:
- Mikhail knows, that respecting rules all the time is really important to make them useful. He is doing it good for now.
- Mikhail felt asleep on time.
- Mikhail is making preparation for his exam on Wednesday every day.

==February 4th, 2024==
Today I had a two hour long lesson with my English teacher at 3:30 pm. At the moment we were preparing for the exam, that will happens this Wednesday. Unexpectedly, I found myself out of gas somewhere in the second half of the lesson. I was physically and mentally exhausted. 

It was a huge surprise for me, because I knew that I could do better than that. Before the lesson I spend about 55 minutes reading and breaking down Crime and Punishment, 20 minutes reading an another book, about 45 minutes doing homework, about 30 minutes cleaning, 25 minute playing with my dog and 30 minutes of playing with my friends. I had no training today. It should not have been enough to wear me out to that extend.

It took me some time to figure out, why this situation happened. I assume, that I tired myself with my own worries (mostly subconsciously). The thing is that today I had to have a lesson with LD (my English teacher), but I got an information form second hands, that my friends would visit us to celebrate my brother's birthday (the party was yesterday, but they were not able to be there yesterday). 

Today we had no internet, even mobile network didn't work properly so I was not able to contact them and ask about the time (yeah, I could go and ask them personally, because they leave nearby, but I didn't want to distract them). I assumed, that they, as always, would visit us around 1 pm. They didn't. The longer I was waiting, the more I was worrying. It would be kind of mean from my side to ignore guests and have a lesson, but I also didn't want to delay my lesson, because I have already delayed it yesterday. 

In the end, they came about 30 minutes before the lesson and I was able to spend some time with them. However, this situation still wore me out. 

\*Mikhail trying to squeeze the last bits of energy to write some kind of a gratitude\*:
- I did good analysing my energy expenses.
- I finished cleaning in my room (though, I still didn't touch almost anything inside furniture, there are a lot of stuff there).
- I also cleared the room where I had a lesson with my teacher (though quite soon, this room will be as jinxed as it was before, because it is used not only by me).

==February 5th, 2024==
I did not do much today. The main reason for that is a slow start of this day, yesterday I felt asleep late, but I was sleeping a healthy amount of time, because of this my morning routine was delayed, I did not manage to complete it before my college lessons started (I'm learning distantly).

I was also taking my sweat time to avoid going outside. Because of this, my dog was staying closed for half of the day (usually, I let it play in our garden).

Anyway, I hope that I will fell asleep on time today and will have a great day tomorrow.

At days like this, finding things to be grateful for tends to be challenging:
- I believe in my success on February 7th (my exam);
- I believe in my success tomorrow;
- I think that I found a couple of pieces that I will need to add to my mentality to become mentally stronger;
- LD (my English teacher) recommended me one book, I growing interested in it quite a bit and looking forward to read it. 

I'm sorry for not catching up with our Discord chat, but I'll do it soon.
==February 6th, 2024==
Tomorrow I will have the exam, that I was preparing for for a long time. I think, that I will have no big problems passing it.

Generally speaking, it was a good day, I did a lot of useful things, however, yesterday and today I was breaking the rules that I stated on February 2nd. I will try my best to avoid it tomorrow.

Just as always, a bit of gratitude:
- I did quite a good amount of homework today;
- I had 2 hours long lesson with my English teacher today;
- Reading and breaking down Crime and Punishment was finally finished. I read 3 chapters today. 
- I continue doing my trainings and posture exercises. 

==February 7th, 2024==
My essay exam finally happened. I don't know my results yet, but I'm sure that I that I did good... or at least, that was what I was planning to say, but I already got the news about successful on that exam. 

Of course, just as always, I was true to my traditions, so I was leaving home at the last moment and had to run to the bus stop.

I left home at 8:08 am and got home at about 4:15 pm. The exam lasted for 235 minutes and it took a lot of energy. The bus was beyond overfilled on both ways, there was no place to even stand properly. I also was in a suit, which was limiting the range of my movements. On top of that I missed a bus on my way back, so I had to wait for an hour for another bus. 

I also got one funny story. I asked one old woman to show me a toilet. She said that I needed to go to the first floor (first layer of building has number 0,  second layer has number 1. It does look awfully similar to the situation in programming for some reason). Suddenly, she stopped me... "hold on... are you... are you a... boy? Ohhh, yeah... sorry-sorry, then your toilet is here, on the ground floor". People mistake me to be a girl sometimes, because of my hair, so it was not a big deal. I paid a visit to the toilet and met her again on the way back. She felt sorry about her misjudgment, so she said: "Oh... I'm so sorry for what I said earlier. Please, don't be angry with me, you just had... such a... girly face" \*smile of a stone face\*. 

I had to do a lot of work when I got home, because I had to skip my classes, but I had no energy. I decided to sleep a bit and it helped me a lot.

Earned gratitude:
- I finally passed my exam, it feels good;
- It was a good decision to take a nap after coming home;
- I still found time to call my granny and father.

==February 8th, 2024==
Today I did some things, but nothing remarkable. 

I also did not manage to do my leg training yesterday, so I decided to do both of my trainings today (don't worry, those trainings are for different groups of muscles, so it was okey to do)

Just as usual, a bit of gratitude:
- I did my trainings;
- I had an English lesson today;
- Usually after big events I tend to loose my grip quite a bit, but it was not a case for today;
- I wrote notes for yesterday and today.

==February 9th, 2024==
There was nothing special about this day, for the most part, it was fruitless.

I promised to start working on my diploma before the next Habitica call that will happen tomorrow. I hope, that I will manage to do that.

\*sounds of hard brainstorming to came up with a creative name for the gratitude section\*:
- I had two hours long English lesson today;
- My English teacher and I took some photos together, it was fun;
- I did my training and scoliosis exercises today.
- I will fall asleep on time today.

==February 10th, 2024==
Today I woke up quite late, however, I did manage to do a few useful things. Our Habitica party also had a call today. It was a good day.

It figures, that it is easier to be grateful to yourself when you really do something, I should try to do this more often:
- I chose the topic for my Diploma project and had a conversation with my classroom teacher about that;
- I send the photos from yesterday to my English teacher;
- I did some help to my mom today (it will be long to describe the details);
- I did some homework today;
- Reading was a part of my day too;
- Preparation for the math exam was there as well.

==February 11th, 2024== 
Is it a gratitude in the very beginning of the note!? Yeah, it is (sorry, I'm running out of ideas for names):
- Yesterday I went to bed on time. I also woke up quite early. It gave a good start to my day;
- I spend 30 minutes training for to my math exam;
- I was reading a book today;
- I did some homework today;
- I did some job for my future English lessons;
- I will fall asleep on time today too;
- I gave calls to my grannies and my father;

I had a low point in the middle of the day. I started watching shorts and spend quite a lot of time doing it. I also was not able to start working again because of the stress, caused by self-blaming. I'm saying it for the Nth time, but I need to be more conscious. Maybe I should make some rule for that, for example, I would need to take 3 breaths before opening any app or web site (or, maybe, before consuming any entertainment content). I can do that as my version of DRWN challenge, that Robert have offered earlier. 

==February 12th, 2024==
On February 2nd in a new set of rules for myself I stated a set of leisure periods for myself. For some reason there was no single day, when I have run out of these sets. I always end the day with a bunch of rest periods that I didn't use. It is a bit frustrating for me when I have to choose between going to sleep on time and using a deserved leisure time. I'm not sure if I should short the number of these sets, because I still think that in theory it is the right amount.

Here we go again, gratitude:
- I had a 90 minutes long English lesson.
- I recreated the essay, that I wrote during the exam on Wednesday to show it to my teacher, she liked it.
- I did my physical education homework, it is the most annoying lesson for me, so it is good that I did it on Monday.
- I'm doing my meditation every day.
- We have a sewer hole in our garden. It got filled, so I pumped the water out of it today. Usually my father is doing it, but I'm glad, that I was able to handle it.

==February 13th, 2024==
Do you remember how yesterday I said, that I don't manage to use all my leisure periods? Forget that, It wasn't the case today, not only I used all of them (and even more), but I also did that without respecting the rules, that I stated earlier. I wasted an enormous amount of time today and will be heading to bed late.

Today was the first day of a new module of my course in Synergy university, holidays ended and this now course will drain my time and energy as well.

Midnight gratitude:
- I did some homework;
- I had a Synergy lecture today.
- I will have a good day tomorrow (I hope so).
- I did my trainings and scoliosis exercises.
- My cat is really cute and warm (yeah, it's not a gratitude for me, but... I don't know... thanks to myself for a... for noticing how cute this fellow is).

==February 14th, 2024==
About my trainings. I put some ambitious goals in the beginning of this year, I'm not sure if I'll be able to reach them, because I don't progress as fast as I was expecting. However, those goals still keep me motivated, so this situation is good enough. I also stuck with my pistol sit ups (one leg sit ups). I constantly find new ways to improve my technic, so the amount of reps does not increase. I think, that it is a good thing, because it is way more interesting to find these tiny progressions, then just increase my endurance.  

At the past three days teacher in our college were not skipping their lessons (we learn distantly). It seems they got scolded by someone from learning department. This change is a duplex sword, at one hand it will take me a lot of time to be present on these lectures, on the other one it will help me to be more disciplined. 

Today was a really warm and nice weather. I wanted to try study outside in the garden of my house, but I wanted to complete my training before that. Sadly, when I finished everything, that I needed to do inside, the weather have changed. Next time I will act quicker. 

All these changes in live is an interesting thing, I wouldn't be so happy to see a warm weather without a cold winter, I wouldn't be so happy with my achievements without my failures. Truly, our perception of life is being defined by the previous experience, everything is known in comparison.

Soooouu, I did mention that I would have a good day today... This day, the whole second half of it, I did nothing useful, I didn't even have an English lesson because there was no internet... Does this mean that I'm a liar? No-no-no... nope! Just as instruction says ("I will have a good day tomorrow"), it was a nice day... warm and sunny... I was tooootally talking about the weather.

My gratitude for myself in a sunny day:
- I had a leg training today, leg days are the hardest ones.
- I still spend some time outside under this beautiful sky while I was playing with my dog and doing a recording for my English lesson.
- I did some homework for the subjects, that I usually delay.
- Tomorrow I will have a nice (productive) day. I will do a lot of homework, my trainings, a big part of my essay for February 20th and participate in Synergy lesson.

==February 15th, 2024==
Almost all day I had no internet. I did some useful things, but feel like I could have done more progress with my essay, that I need to finish before February 20th.

Some quick name for gratitude part:
- I did a few English recordings today;
- I did a lot of stretching;
- I did some homework;
- I had a bit of a productive day, but tomorrow is going to be better;
- I keep tracking my calories.

==February 16th, 2024==
Yesterday I felt asleep quite late. Because of this the start of my day was quite weak. As always, waking up late means, that my morning routine got mixed with my lectures and, as the result, takes way more time and energy. I also did not do almost any work regarding my essay for February 20th. Anyway, even with that I had quite a good day, because the middle of it was quite solid.

Showing gratitude to myself while drinking tea (yeah, I'm running out of ideas):
- I manage to do quite a lot even when there were quite a lot of things going on today.
- I made a lot of progress with one subject, that I wasn't paying much time for the last few weeks.
- I cleared my schedule for tomorrow, so I will be able to dedicate a lot of time for my essay (there are still quite a lot of things to do, but they can wait until Monday)
- I'm doing some cleaning everyday.
- I'm writing notes every day.
- I had a two hour long English lesson today.

==February 17th, 2024==
I have to finish one essay until February 20th. I have signed up for this competition a few weeks ago. I found this situation to be a good source of motivation to write on one of the topics that I wanted to talk about for a long time. I think that the idea itself was great, but my execution was just... not... not perfect... at all. 

I was delaying this work for a long time and it is February 17th now and I done only a small piece of the essay. Furthermore, I had to choose easier topic, because of the lack of time. I will not be able to do a decent work and it is really frustrating. I will remember this frustration properly, I don't want to do same mistakes again.

Squeezing gratitude out of Mikhail:
- I participated in Habitica call, which was quite interesting;
- I did some homework (yeah, It was just writing summaries of lectures and it was another way of procrastination, but it is still better then doing nothing useful at all);
- I really spend some time trying to write something decent (efforts itself still counts);
- I will fall asleep on time today.

==February 18th, 2024==
I dedicated this day to the essay, that I will have to complete until February 20th for one competition. I did some job on it yesterday and the day before that, but didn't like the result. I was consulting with my English teacher about the essay and during the process I came up with another topic, that I find more suited under the given circumstances. 

I had to start everything from the scratch, but the result appeared to be acceptable. I need to thank LD (my English teacher) for helping me a lot, she found some quotes, that I needed, and helped me to find weak and unclear spots in the way how I deliver my ideas.

Though I wrote only Russian version and I will have to translate the whole thing tomorrow. I will have classes and training, so it is going to be hard to manage to do the whole translation in one day. 

Another problem, is that there is a chance, that I will have to cut a half of the text because of the length limitations. Considering the fact that I was withholding myself from detailed explanations and it still was not enough, it is going to be quite painful to cut my work like this. 

It's about the time to write some gratitude:
- It's a good thing that I decided to change the topic;
- I did good work working on my essay today;
- I'm happy to have such a kind and caring teacher like LD.

==February 19th, 2024==
Today I had to finish my essay (also known as scientific work). In parallel to that I had to take my classes in college, including one test. I also had a training today.

I did the the translation of the whole thing (4 pages of 12th size letters). I was waiting for it to take less time (it's only about 13 hundred words, some of my daily notes are half as long as this essay), but it appeared that the real problem was the quality of speech in this text. I needed to be precise with my words which was really time and energy consuming (don't be confused by how low the quality of my speech now,  I just run out of energy at this point). 

It also appeared that I had to do a presentation for my work today. I did it under 90 minutes, so it is really short and junky. Of course, if I didn't take as many breaks throughout the day I could have more time left, but what's done is done.

It is not rare for me to stay up until a midnight, but this time I was tired way more than usual. I'm not going to lie, this day was brutal. It is a miracle in some form that I was able to pay that my time for this project, but I will surely pay for this in the few nearest days.

Gratitude of a tired guy:
- I worked hard today.
- My essay appeared to be not bad.
- The translation has some interesting English constructions here and there.
- I did my training even under these circumstances.
- I wrote this note.
- I'm really grateful to LD for helping me throughout the whole way

==February 20th, 2024==
Today was a really busy day. I'm still making up for the time that I spend working on that essay. During the day I had to mix my study in college, helping my father with cutting trees, training, making up for a lesson of Synergy  course that I skipped because of the lack of internet on the last Thursday and Synergy class itself. I did manage to find some time for physical rest, but not for leisure. It can sound like whining, but it was just frustrating to me that I was not able to use leisure time that I earned (there are some rule that I have for myself regarding leisure time).

At about 8 pm I finished the most important tasks, but still had a bid of things, that I wanted to finish, so I did not go to sleep. I ended up spending about 3 hours watching anime, which is not good. I should have just go to sleep. I recall that someone mentioned something about this during one of Habitica calls (sometimes people are so frustrated with not giving themselves time for fun stuff, that they are having doing it at night instead of sleeping). Anyway, what's done is done, I'll try not to repeat the same mistake again.

I also noticed, that I forgot to take a bath. My bath timings were inconsistent, so I created a schedule for that. Surprisingly, I found that I was acting according to this schedule quite well and had a good stacks until today. 

Gratitude of a man, who is sitting on a chair (yeah, my imagination is that bad):
- I helped my father today, it's good;
- I managed to mostly catch up on my Synergy course;
- I decided not to do any tricks to save my stacks (taking a bath and calling my granny), I think that it will be a good lesson for me;
- I'm analyzing my mistakes.

==February 21st, 2024==
This day does not differ much from yesterday. Though I can't find any time to work on my diploma project and exams, I'm really worried about this.

An attempt to make a quick gratitude:
- thanks to Mikhail for helping his father;
- for doing legs workout today;
- for trying hard to be better.
==February 22nd, 2024==
Today was a bit strange day. I did ok in the first half of the day.
