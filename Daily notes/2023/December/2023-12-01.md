Диктант
	I spend the nights reading Greek until 4 in the morning, until my eyes burned and my head swam. When I could no longer concentrate of Greek, I read The Great Gatsby. It is one of my favourite books and I had taken it and I had taken it out of the library in hopes, that it would cheer me up; of course it only made me feel worse, since in my own humorless state I failed to see anything except  what I construed as certain tragic similarities between Gatsby and myself.
